","Affenpinschers are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as luxating patella, heart anomalies, vision problems, and hip dysplasia. Like other shorter-faced breeds, Affens can experience breathing problems during hot weather if they are permitted to overheat and then have difficulty panting in order to lower their body temperature, as dogs don't sweat to keep cool.","The Affenpinscher's medium-length, wiry coat should be groomed twice a week, first with a brush and then with a metal comb. Any mats should be pulled apart with the fingers. The hair on the head is usually brushed forward over the face, and then an inverted V-shape is cut to expose the eyes. Similarly, the hair on the bridge of the nose is trimmed into a fan shape to keep the eyes clear. The Affen's coat does not grow quickly, so a trimming a pet Affen every few months should suffice. The breed's national parent club, the Affenpinscher Club of America, provides a detailed grooming guide. Affens should also have their nails trimmed and their teeth brushed regularly.","One of the attractions of the toy breeds is that their small size makes them ideal apartment dogs. While Affenpinschers can be perfectly happy living in close quarters, the breed is classified as 'moderately active,' and as such, they do need exercise. Indoor play, both with his owner and just between himself and a toy, can be enough to make up a large chunk of an Affen's exercise regimen. Even so, a brisk walk once or twice a day is required. In addition to providing exercise, these walks give the Affen a chance to socialize both with people and other dogs.","Affenpinschers are courageous, bold, and often feisty. Basic obedience training is recommended. The breed has an undeserved reputation as being difficult to train because Affenpinschers are independent minded and can be stubborn. The key is that they are very intelligent and generally eager to please the humans they have bonded with. Keep in mind that they are easily bored and tend to lose interest during long training sessions. Shorter, more frequent sessions with a trainer who has experience working with toy breeds are usually quite successful."

","Sighthounds such as Afghans have naturally low stores of body fat, so they tend to be sensitive to anesthesia; breed experts recommend seeking out a sighthound-savvy veterinarian for surgical procedures. Like other deep-chested types of dogs, Afghan Hounds can experience bloat, a sudden and life-threatening swelling of the abdomen, and owners should educate themselves about its symptoms and what to do should bloat occur.","Afghan puppies have short, fuzzy coats (including adorable facial hair called 'monkey whiskers') that require little maintenance. They don't stay that way for long, however. As is to be expected, the long, silky coat of an adolescent or adult Afghan requires regular grooming. Several hours per week of brushing are needed to keep the hair free of tangles and mats, as well as to remove any debris. Keeping the hair clean and mat-free is the key to keeping the Afghan's glorious coat looking its best. Regular bathing, with shampoo and conditioner, is also required. Like all breeds, Afghans should have their nails trimmed and their teeth brushed regularly.","Because Afghans are sighthounds, bred to hunt and chase prey by sight, they will have a strong instinct to run off in pursuit of perceived prey; walking off leash is not advisable. Short walks do not provide enough exercise for this athletic breed, and some owners take their leashed Afghans on long runs once they reach maturity. Ideally, an Afghan should have the opportunity to run full out several times a week in a large, enclosed area. Afghans are tall, lean, and strong, which makes them excellent jumpers, so their exercise area must have a high, secure fence.","Afghans are independent, dignified, and aloof in general, but they are affectionate and extremely loyal to humans they have bonded with. This loyalty can make it difficult for an adult Afghan to adjust to a new home. On the other hand, it can make them fairly easy to housetrain, because they want to please their owners. Unless obedience or agility competition is a goal, teaching basic commands such as come, sit, and stay is generally sufficient. Afghan Hound owners are often quick to point out that no amount of training will overcome the breed's hunting instinct to break off on a high-speed chase."
2,airedale-terrier,~23 inches,~50-70 pounds,11-14 years,3,3,3,1,3,1,Wiry,Short-Medium,3,3,5,3,3,3,3,3,62 of 1,Black & Tan-Grizzle & Tan,,"Owning a dog is not just a privilege; it’s a responsibility.

","Airedales are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will test for health concerns such as hip dysplasia, a malformation of the hip joint. An Airedale's ears should be checked regularly to remove foreign matter and avoid a buildup of wax, and his teeth should be brushed regularly.","The Airedale has a short, wiry coat that needs relatively little maintenance. Weekly brushing keeps the coat looking good and has the additional advantage of removing dead hair that would otherwise be shed around the house. (Some people with dog allergies have found that they can share a living space with a well-brushed Airedale without suffering any symptoms.) If the weekly session turns up any mats, they should be broken up with the fingers and then teased apart with a comb. Full grooming '¿ where the dog is bathed, brushed, and stripped or clipped '¿ should be done three or four times a year, either by the owner or a professional groomer.","Terriers are generally known for their high energy levels. Given that the Airedale is the largest of all terriers, that energy must be channeled into safe outlets. Fortunately, Airedales love to play with other family members. A daily play session of moderate length, in addition to walks (or backyard time) several times a day, should be enough to satisfy the Airedale's exercise requirements. Airedales play well with children, but interactions with toddlers and smaller children should be closely supervised. Airedales are rangy but strong; that strength, combined with a boisterous personality, can lead to mishaps.","Because of the Airedale's size (he is a medium-sized dog, but the largest of the terrier breeds), strength, and rambunctiousness, obedience training is highly recommended. At a minimum, an Airedale should learn basic obedience commands such as come, sit, and stay. The breed's intelligence and the fact that they bond closely with family members can make training easy. Owners and trainers should keep in mind that an intelligent dog is an easily bored dog, so varied training sessions will be more successful than repetitive ones. Also, an easily bored dog who is often left alone for long periods of time will tend to develop undesirable behaviors. It often helps to provide the dog with challenging toys that will keep him happily occupied."

","Like many dogs, Akitas can experience bloat, a sudden, life-threatening condition where the stomach can twist without veterinary intervention. Bloat is a medical emergency, and Akita owners should learn to recognize the signs. Prospective owners should be sure to work with a reputable breeder who tests his or her breeding stock for health concerns such as eye and thyroid disorders, and hip dysplasia, a malformation of the hip joints that can cause pain and arthritis.","Akitas tend to be clean and have little 'doggy odor.' They don't require extensive grooming, but their thick, luxurious double coat should be brushed at least once a week to look its best. Although Akitas shed only minimally most of the time, expect their dense undercoat to 'blow' twice a year, where it will shed so profusely that it comes out in clumps all over your house. During this time it helps to brush the dog more frequently to get rid of the dead coat. The nails should also be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause pain and problems for the dog. Remember also to brush the dog's teeth often to ensure dental health.","The Akita is generally not a highly active breed but does require moderate exercise. A jog or brisk walk around the block at least once a day can meet the needs of most individuals of the breed. Akitas also enjoy playing energetically. Although they are large dogs '¿ males often weigh more than 100 pounds '¿ with sufficient daily exercise Akitas can do well in a relatively small home. They are hardy dogs bred to withstand the harsh outdoor conditions of northern Japan, but they were bred as housedogs and guardians as well as hunters, and adapt very well to life in the home.","Akitas are very intelligent and loyal but also have an independent, headstrong nature. As large and very powerful dogs, it is vital that they are trained consistently,  beginning in puppyhood. They are instinctive guardians, so it's especially important that Akitas have early and extensive socialization when young. They must learn to accept a wide variety of strangers and not perceive them as a threat. Because of their independence and strong prey drive, they should never be off lead in an unsecured area. Akitas tend to be aggressive toward other dogs, particularly of the same sex, and extreme caution should be used in canine interactions."

","The Alaskan Klee Kai (AKK) is a generally healthy breed.  Responsible breeders screen breeding stock for health conditions including patellar luxation, autoimmune thyroiditis, heart murmur, eye disorders, and Factor VII deficiency.  Prospective AKK owners are  encouraged to purchase from responsible/reputable breeders who are doing these  evaluations, and confirm the health screening of the sire and dam.  Responsible breeders use the many tools available, along with the knowledge of their dogs¿ pedigrees, to  selectively choose breeding dogs in order to reduce the likelihood of temperament,  structure and health concerns.    ","The Alaskan Klee Kai (AKK) is a double coated breed, with a short dense undercoat and a longer outer coat of guard hairs. This coat not only helps insulate them from the cold and heat, it also helps protect the skin from the sun. While the undercoat is shed (or blown) twice a year, some owners quip that it lasts for six months at a time. Weekly brushings and/or combing help keep the coat and skin in good condition, and help reduce the hair around the house.  AKK often need only a few baths a year as their coats tend to naturally repel dirt, and they do not have the ¿dog odor¿ that many breeds have. Blowing the dog with a strong cool blow-dryer is also a good way to remove loose hair and dirt. Avoid using any tools with blades. The nails should be trimmed regularly to prevent any foot problems.  Alaskan Klee Kai competing in conformation require a bit more selective grooming or bathing for the best presentation. The breed standard is specific: ""The Alaskan Klee Kai is shown in its natural state and the only trimming permissible is around the foot area to present a clean/neat appearance. Any trimming of the whiskers, or the fur on any other part of the dog, is to be severely penalized.""","The Alaskan Klee Kai (AKK) is an active dog with a medium-high energy level. Regular exercise and doing activities together, both physically and mentally, strengthens the bond between dog and owner, and helps to avoid potential destructive behavior. AKK enjoy doing performance sports or exploring life with their people in many activities such as camping, hiking, climbing, swimming, boating, kayaking, and even on paddle boards! For those who live in a more urban setting, or have a more sedate lifestyle, daily walks or a game of fetch can also provide great exercise. Alaskan Klee Kai are foremost loving companion dogs who form strong bonds with their family and are as happy playfully interacting with their owners exploring the outdoors as they are relaxing lovingly on the laps of their youthful or elderly owners. Like many dog breeds, Alaskan Klee Kai are curious, clever, fast and sneaky, and may have a high prey drive, so it is important to keep the dog on a leash or in a securely fenced yard (or secured area) at all times when outside of the home. AKK are not suitable for people who cannot spend time with their dogs","The Alaskan Klee Kai are a perceptive breed that enjoys being physically and mentally challenged. They love learning new things, and have an energetic eagerness to participate in a broad array of activities which make them well suited for multiple performance sports such as Agility, Racing, Obedience, Rally, Scent Work, Weight Pull, Dock Diving, and Carting. They are also used in therapy work, service work, diabetic and gluten detection, as well as emotional support dogs. AKK have a sensitive, reserved and cautious nature. A gentle hand, positive reinforcement, proper early socialization and training throughout their lives is very beneficial."

","A responsible breeder will screen breeding stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia (a malformation of the hip joint that is the most common skeletal condition in dogs), elbow dysplasia, thrombopathia, chondrodysplasia ('dwarfism'), hypothyroidism, inherited polyneuropathy, von Willebrand's disease, and day blindness. As with all breeds, an Alaskan Malamute's ears should be checked regularly to remove foreign matter and avoid a buildup of wax, and his teeth should be brushed regularly.","The thick, waterproof double coat of the Alaskan Malamute is beautifully adapted to harsh Arctic life, but it requires constant upkeep. A Malamute should be brushed every day with a pin brush and metal comb, all the while checking for mats, which can harbor fungus, and hot spots, which can become infected. Twice a year, during shedding season, an undercoat rake should be added to the regimen. Show Malamutes are often bathed weekly, but a pet Malamute can go six to eight weeks between baths.  Conditioner can be used, in moderation, if the coat feels dry. As with all breeds, the Malamute's nails should be trimmed regularly.","While the Malamute was not bred for racing, he was bred to work. A strong, athletic dog with tremendous endurance, designed to carry heavy loads, a Mal requires daily exercise. Romping in a well-fenced yard or other enclosed space will suffice, but Malamutes also enjoy hiking, running, and swimming with their owners. And should the owner have sufficient time and interest, Malamutes often take part in agility and obedience trials, weight-pulling competitions, backpacking (yes, you can buy a backpack for your dog), recreational or competitive sledding, and skijoring (pulling a person who is on skis).","Socialization and obedience training are necessary in order to prevent a Malamute from becoming pushy with children and other pets, or dominant over adults he or she doesn't respect. Malamutes are highly intelligent but also independent and willful, often to the point of stubbornness. While fairness and patience can yield a devoted, trustworthy companion, there are certain behaviors that may be impossible to train out of a Mal, such as digging, so any yard fencing must continue into the ground. And Malamutes are not especially suited to be guard dogs because they tend to be friendly with everyone they meet."

","The American Bulldog is considered a healthy breed. Owners should maintain a schedule of examinations and vaccinations as recommended by their veterinarian. Hip and joint problems are a concern for this breed, hip and elbow evaluations should also be done. Just like other breeds, the American Bulldog has the potential to develop genetic health problems. Breeders should pre-screen any potential breeding pairs for genetic diseases.","Grooming your American Bulldog can be a pretty easy task. This breed does not need to be bathed often, only occasional baths when they become dirty. Regular brushing will help keep their coat clean and shiny. Their nails should be trimmed every few weeks and ears should be cleaned once a month or as needed. Their teeth should be brushed regularly. Seasonal shedding is to be expected.","The American Bulldog is an athlete. For puppies, owners will need to practice non-impact exercises to decrease possible bone and joint damage. As adults, the American Bulldog will need a range of activities from jogs, hikes, tug-a-war games, to training exercises. The breed does not do well being left alone in a back yard. As this may lead to a variety of behavior problems related to pent-up energy. This breed requires frequent exercise and constant stimulation. Developing his athletic abilities will help this breed stay fit and happy.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are vital in channeling the American Bulldog's energy. Rules and routines should be put in place early and adhered to as dogs grow up. They require a firm but loving hand to establish and retain proper boundaries. The more exposure to good training practices, other dogs, and people, the more likely the success at being managed both inside and outside of their environment."

","Still bred primarily as a hard-working dog, which must have an efficient physical condition, the American English Coonhound is generally a healthy breed. Responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as hip and elbow dysplasia as well as eye disorders such as progressive retinal atrophy and cataracts. His ears should be checked regularly to remove excess wax and debris. Like other large and deep-chested breeds, he can experience bloat, a sudden, life-threatening stomach condition. Owners should learn the signs of bloat and what to do should it occur.","Good nutrition influences the shine and texture of your American English Coonhound's coat from the inside, but he will still need regular grooming to be at his best. His short, hard, protective coat requires a minimum of care. Using a shedding tool or a grooming mitt with rubber nubs at least weekly will help to keep his shedding to a minimum. This also distributes skin oils down the hair shaft, giving his coat a natural shine. His nails should be trimmed once a month, and a bath every four to six weeks will keep the coat and skin clean and healthy, and reduce doggy odor. His ears should be checked weekly and gently cleaned of any excess wax or debris.","With his high energy level and innate desire to be part of a pack, whether human or canine, the American English is an ideal candidate as a companion for someone who is an active runner, biker, or hiker. He needs a lot of exercise to stay healthy and happy. The breed has a very strong prey drive, so should never be allowed off leash in an uncontrolled situation, as he will not be able to resist the instinct to follow an interesting scent he detects with his sensitive nose. He requires a fenced area where he can run freely. Chasing a ball in his backyard can be an excellent source of exercise.","Following through with proper early socialization of your American English Coonhound is paramount, or your puppy may become possessive over food or toys in your home. The key to a well-adjusted, mentally healthy dog is to have him experience positive interactions with many different kinds of people in a variety of places and situations. Like many hounds, English dogs have a split personality: tenacious, tireless, and stubborn on the trail, but at home these spirited hunters are sweetly amiable companions. Still, the breed's limitless prey drive and energy, the patience it takes to train them for anything other than coon hunting, and their tendency to bark in a loud, ringing voice make them most appropriate for experienced dog owners."

However, Eskies shed almost constantly. A thorough brushing two or three times a week will remove dead hairs before they can be shed, as well as help to prevent matting. The oil on an Eskie's fur prevents dirt from adhering, so a good brushing is usually enough to remove it. It is OK to bathe  an Eskie occasionally, but doing so more than once every few months can make his skin dry and irritated. As with all breeds, the Eskie's nails should be trimmed regularly.","An active dog with lots of energy, the Eskie is also quick and curious, requiring lots of exercise and mental challenges. An Eskie who is left alone or who doesn't get enough exercise can quickly become destructive. A securely fenced yard and an assortment of toys will help provide good exercise and stimulation to keep an Eskie out of trouble. He shouldn't just be left out in the yard by himself all day, however. Despite his warm coat, the Eskie is an indoor dog, and he forms strong bonds with his people and is happiest interacting with them. Once they pass middle age, Eskies often become more sedate.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Fortunately, the American Eskimo Dog is among the most trainable of all breeds.

That's why an American Foxhound needs at least a solid hour or two of exercise every day'¿if he doesn't get it, he may become bored and destructive. If they get all the activity they need, they can fit in pretty much anywhere. While they are happiest living indoors with their human family, American Foxhounds make great companions on long walks or hikes. Because they were bred to hunt and chase animals and to follow a scent, they should only be allowed loose in areas that are securely fenced, and any walks must be taken on a leash. The breed also exercises mind and body by participating in canine sports such as tracking, rally, coursing ability tests, and other activities that can be enjoyed together by dog and owner.","American Foxhounds are easygoing and amiable. They also can be stubborn and independent, however, which can make training an exercise in patience. Obedience classes are recommended, and as scenthounds, it may never be safe to have them off-leash, because their noses can lead them into trouble. Foxhounds raised in the home tend to be wonderfully mild-tempered, devoted, and easygoing companions, and they get along well with children. Even so, owners will need patience and persistence when training them, and hounds can develop unwanted behaviors if not given enough exercise."

Thanks to their high trainability, they can do well in a wide range of canine activities such as obedience, rally, and agility competitions.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations between the ages of about 7 weeks and 4 months will help him develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult.

Options for exercise include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or walks several times a day. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or teaching them new tricks. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise. As a hunting breed with energy to spare, American Leopards would do best as part of an active, rural family.","American Leopard Hounds are eager to please and, therefore, easy to train.

","The Am Staff is a robust, healthy breed, and a responsible breeder will screen breeding stock for these health conditions such as canine hip dysplasia, cardiac disease, and skin and coat allergies. A genetic test has recently been developed for cerebellar ataxia, which causes a progressive decline in muscle coordination, first appearing between ages 3 and 5 years; now, by identifying dogs with the mutation, breeders can avoid producing it in their bloodlines. As with all breeds, the ears should be checked regularly, and the dog's teeth should be brushed often.","Taking care of the AmStaff's short, stiff coat is remarkably easy. A quick once-over with a soft bristle brush every week is usually enough to remove any dirt or other foreign matter. What's more, a good brushing distributes skin oils throughout the coat to help keep it healthy. If an Am Staff gets into something particularly messy, a bath will probably be called for. Otherwise, bathing can wait until when and if he develops a 'doggy' smell. As with all breeds, the AmStaff'¿s nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can be painful and cause the dog problems while walking and running.","An athletic, energetic dog such as the American Staffordshire Terrier requires a lot of exercise. Leaving the dog out in the yard all day is not the right approach, however: Yes, he can run around, but the AmStaff is a people-oriented dog who thrives when he is made part of the family. Long play sessions with his owner develop his physical and psychological health. In addition, many AmStaffs enjoy taking part in canine sports such as obedience, agility, and dock diving. AmStaffs are even trained in search-and-rescue and excel at it.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended for all breeds, but given the AmStaff's strong will, physical strength, and exuberance, they are a necessity. The breed's intelligence and desire to please make training a fun, easy process. Even so, certain behaviors, such as chewing and digging, may be hard to resolve. It must be noted that dog aggression can develop even in well-socialized Am Staffs; an AmStaff should never under any circumstances be left alone with other dogs."

The breed was bred to work in the icy waters of the Great Lakes region, and its insulating, double-layer coat makes that possible. Weekly grooming is required, but it is a fairly simple process. During the summer, the coat is sparser, and can be brought into shape with a rubber-tipped pin brush. The rest of the year, and especially during shedding season, a slicker brush should be used to remove the dead hair from the undercoat. As with all breeds, the American Water Spaniel'¿s nails should be trimmed regularly.","American Water Spaniels are outdoorsy athletes who love hunting and swimming, so they need ample exercise. Without sufficient activity, they can become barky and destructive. At a minimum, vigorous play sessions with their owner or a companion dog in a park or a large backyard are needed every day. They truly thrive, however, when given a job to do and make great hunting companions'¿after all, it's in their DNA. Participating in field trials or obedience, agility, or dock diving events will give the American Water Spaniel a chance to burn off all that excess energy in a positive way.","As with all breeds, early socialization puppy training classes are highly recommended. Socialization'¿gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations between the ages of about 7 weeks and 4 months'¿will help him develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult. American Water Spaniels are often aloof with strangers, and some may have a touch of stubbornness, but they are happy creatures who want nothing more than to please their owners. This makes training them easy and fun. Given this breed's energy and innate talents, owners and their dogs enjoy participating together in canine sports such as tracking agility, barn hunt, and flyball, as well as field events, which teach the dog to flush game and retrieve waterfowl."

","The Anatolian is overall a healthy and hardy breed. Hip dysplasia is not common in Anatolians, nor is bloat, a life-threatening twisting and inversion of the stomach. Owners should know the symptoms of bloat, however, so as to act quickly should it occur. The breed can be sensitive to anesthesia, and owners should ensure that their vet is aware of this before any procedures. Good breeders will screen for entropion, in which the eyelids invert, which can be surgically corrected.

Remember, though, that an Anatolian must be kept on leash whenever he is taken out of the home. As one breeder says, ""Don't assume that your dogs will be reliable off leash. False security on your part can become a disaster.'","Because the breed tends to be wary toward others and instinctively protective, an Anatolian puppy must be socialized. Obedience training is a must with the breed.

",The Barbado   da Terceira has a propensity for Hip Dysplasia.,"The Barbado da Terceira should be bathed only on an ¿as-needed¿ basis.  If brushed well, they will not need to be bathed often as bathing strips the dog of valuable skin oils.  A bath every two months should therefore be adequate. Puppy hair needs to be brushed regularly. One must especially watch for tangles between the toes and clipped if found. Hair that grows too long over the eyes should also be trimmed. When the adult coat starts to grow, and the puppy hair falls out, loose hairs often get stuck in the new coat and can cause tangles, especially in the neck. These are difficult to remove, especially if the real coat   gets  longer. Hair should be brushed well down to the skin, working from the legs upwards. If this is too difficult, they should be shaved  to 1-1 ½   inches (7F clipper). Because the Barbado does not shed, hair should be trimmed when it gets too long. Trimming summer is not needed as the undercoat takes care of the heat. They need to be brushed at least weekly to ensure that hair is not matted and that twigs and burrs are removed. Their nails should be checked every few weeks and trimmed as needed. Many have back dew claws that need to be trimmed. Removal is not recommended. Ears should be checked once a week and cleaned as needed. Hair inside the ear may be removed with ear powder but should not be cut. Their teeth should be brushed regularly.","Daily exercise is crucial. These dogs are so smart that they must be mentally, as well as physically, stimulated. They do not need a fenced- in yard, preferring to stay close to home and to their people. They are territorial of their home and yard so must be supervised if neighborhood dogs live nearby. Barbado da Terceira's are happiest when they have a cow to herd, but if these are not available, a ball will do.  They will willingly walk, hike, or jog with their human. Agility courses and herding courses, if available, are also great substitutes for those not living on a farm. Owners whose flowers are eaten by deer will be in awe of the agility with which the Barbado da Terceira herds them - away - from their homes. Barbado da Terceira's will be giddy and vocal when playing with each   other.  Other breeds may be initially confused by the BTD¿s earnest play but they quickly become accustomed to it.","The Barbado da Terceira is an assertive breed.  She needs firm, consistent, and loving   training from an early age. Instincts don¿t simply go away. The herding   instinct is a prey instinct that has been contained through selective breeding and training. Herding dogs may often nip at their people¿s  (especially children) heels in an effort to ¿herd¿ them. Sometimes this over-stimulation of instinctual behaviors, if not dealt with, leads to incorrigible behavior that will be increasingly difficult to turn around.  She needs firm, consistent, and loving training from an early age. Barbado da Terceiras are cattle herders and not a protection breed. They will protect their people though. Since herding breeds exist to keep their flocks safe from predators; their vision and hearing is superb.  They may vocalize at any visual change in their environment or any sounds with which they are unfamiliar. Due to the Barbado da Terceira¿s beauty, intelligence, and joyful nature, they are increasingly popular family pets on the mainland of Portugal,  throughout Europe and in the U.S.A., however, they need to be physically and mentally active to be successful pets. They are good with children, but should be supervised. They are also good with other dogs, but must be supervised if with an unfamiliar dog. Dominant Barbado da Terceiras may fight other dogs so early socialization with many dogs is key. The  Barbado da Terceira is recommended for those with some or much experienced dog owners. Positive reinforcement should be used.  When this is not enough, they may have to have a ¿time out¿ to become calm again. The  Barbado da Terceira is a sensitive dog that is quite willing to please and harsh punishment may result in the opposite of what is intended.  If treated harshly, the Barbado da Terceira may become anxious or frightened, which can lead to long-term behavioral issues such as aggression. New owners who consider sending their puppies to overnight training centers must recognize the potential long-term consequences of such training. While the training might ¿correct¿ unwanted behaviors in the short term, there is no guarantee that the puppy will not be traumatized, leading to more undesirable behaviors in the long term.  This is true even of training centers that come with the best recommendations and that promise that they will only use positive reinforcement. Puppies are not one-size-fits-all and your trainer will not be familiar with the needs of your  Barbado da Terceira puppy, regardless of his/her assertions of familiarity with all dogs. The new puppy must bond with its owners; sending him/her away will lead to   depression and feelings of abandonment and will most likely break bonds that have already been formed.  There is no replacement for firm, consistent, but loving training by their human begins in the first moment that a new puppy is brought home."

He actually has webbed paws specifically for swimming. Besides swimming, other options for exercise include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or taken for walks several times a day. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or teaching them new tricks. The Barbet enjoys plenty of playtime with dogs and people, but is then content to lounge nearby indoors. He is happiest when well socialized and prefers not to spend too many hours alone.","Positive interactions and and upbeat training environment are needed for a Barbet, as the breed has a sensitive, but even, temperament. Training should be a relatively easy task, as Barbets are friendly, responsive, and agreeable. Agility, rally, dock diving, and lure coursing are all dog sports that Barbets have participated in, and make for great exercise and mental stimulation."

","Basenji are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders screen for health disorders such as hypothyroidism, a type of inflammatory bowel disease called IPSID and canine hip dysplasia. Gene tests are available to identify carriers of Fanconi syndrome, a kidney disorder, as well as progressive retinal atrophy, or PRA; such tests allow breeders to plan breedings that will not produce those diseases. As with all breeds, a Basenji's ears should be checked regularly, and the teeth should be brushed often.","Basenjis are fastidious creatures. Their short coat is a breeze to take care of, generally requiring no more than a quick once-over with a soft-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove every week. Brushing distributes skin oils throughout the coat to help keep it healthy and looking its best. Basenjis don't have a 'doggy' smell, and they usually don't need to be bathed unless they get into something particularly messy. As with all breeds, the Basenji'¿s nails should be trimmed regularly, because overly long nails can cause the dog pain as well as problems walking and running.","Basenjis are energetic, inquisitive, and very active. They require lots of regular exercise to keep them from becoming bored. Boredom can lead to destructive behavior. Long play sessions in a well-fenced yard or securely on lead are required. A Basenji should never run loose, as the breed's instinct to hunt is very strong, and the dog might not be able to resist the urge to run off on a chase. Giving the dog a structured outlet for those instincts and that pent-up energy can help immensely; many Basenjis enjoy, and excel at, canine sports such as lure coursing, tracking, and obedience and agility competitions.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended for all breeds, but given the Basenji's bountiful energy, intelligence, and penchant for mischief, they are a necessity. Basenjis are often described as 'catlike,' which may not seem to bode well for training them. However, they do learn readily in an encouraging and rewarding atmosphere, and with the use of positive-training techniques. They also lose interest quickly, so training sessions should last no more than five or 10 minutes."

","The Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a relatively healthy dog, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health concerns such as progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), epilepsy, cardiomyopathies, skin allergies and age-related thyroid issues. A gene test for primary open angle glaucoma is now available, meaning breeders are able to identify carriers and avoid producing this eye anomaly. The vast majority of Fauves are very healthy and enjoy longevity, with many living to be 16 plus years old. Working with a responsible breeder can help those wishing to own a Fauve to gain the knowledge they need about specific health concerns within the breed. Good breeders utilize genetic testing of their breeding dogs to reduce the likelihood of problems with their puppies.","The Basset Fauve de Betagne is almost a 'wash-and-wear' dog, with a coarse, wiry coat that repels dirt and resists matting. Some dogs have more coat than others. Longhaired dogs can be hand-stripped. All require grooming weekly with a fine-toothed comb, followed by a stiff brush. Shedding is seasonal. Nails should be trimmed regularly to avoid overgrowth and splitting. Teeth should be brushed and ears checked regularly.","Basset Fauves are energetic and love to play. Regular walks need to be on a leash as they can run off and follow their nose at a moment's notice. Areas for exercise and play, such as a backyard, should be fenced for the same reasons. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or teaching them new tricks. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise.","The Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a small scent hound, bred originally to find rabbits. The nose goes to the ground and can overpower the brain if the dog is not trained from an early age to tune into his human.

","Because of the Basset's ears are long and droopy, it's important to check them frequently to ensure that air circulation hasn't led to an infection. Shaking the head or scratching at the ears may indicate the need for a vet visit. Responsible breeders check for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, bleeding disorders, and luxating patella, a dislocated kneecap once called a 'trick knee' in humans. Brushing your dog's teeth with specially formulated canine toothpaste at least twice a week is also a vital part of Basset health care.","Although it might seem that with his short, smooth hair the Basset Hound won't need any grooming, that's not quite the case. Regular grooming sessions are an important part of keeping the breed healthy and happy. The Basset's short hair can shed profusely. Shedding can be kept under control by gently going over the dog at least once a week with a soft brush or a shedding tool. As well as removing hair that is ready to shed, grooming is like an all-body massage that benefits his skin and overall health. The Basset will also need his nails trimmed regularly, and an occasional bath will help to keep his coat clean and shiny.","Basset Hounds are not as active as some breeds, but they do require regular, moderate exercise. Usually a daily walk at a moderate pace will fill the bill. Exercise will help to keep the Basset healthy and prevent him from becoming overweight. Since the breed was developed to work in a pack with other dogs, Bassets enjoy canine company on their outings, and the breed can be quite playful. After a walk or play session they'll typically settle down for a comfortable sleep.","Basset Hounds are very independent, and training the breed can be a challenge. Over the centuries, scenthounds of this type were developed to hunt on their own and to follow a track without distraction. Because of this, they can seem aloof and not interested in following your commands. However, a Basset definitely can be trained'¿it will just take time, consistency, and persistence. Using treats and early socialization in puppyhood is crucial, and as the Basset matures he and his owner can benefit from continued positive obedience training."

This doesn't mean just letting them out in the backyard. Beagles were bred to work in packs and are happiest when they have company. A Beagle who is left alone inside or outside for long periods of time will tend to become destructive. This can be avoided if he has a companion (whether human or canine) to play with. Beagles are escape artists, so an exercise area must have a fence at least five feet tall that extends underground to prevent tunneling. Walks must always be taken on a leash, because as a scenthound with a very strong hunting instinct, a Beagle will not be able to resist the urge to run off in pursuit of a compelling scent.","As with all dogs, early socialization and puppy training classes are a must.

As with all breeds, a Beardie's ears should be checked regularly to remove foreign matter and avoid a buildup of wax, and the teeth brushed daily.","The Beardie grooming regimen consists of two parts. The first is a daily brushing to remove tangles and foreign matter, which shouldn't take more than five or ten minutes, assuming the dog hasn't gotten into something messy. The second part is a weekly session with a pin rake, brush, comb, and possibly anti-tangle spray to remove dead hair and return the coat to pristine condition. This generally takes a half-hour to an hour. As with all breeds, the Beardie's nails should be trimmed regularly, because overly long nails can cause the dog pain as well as problems walking and running.","The Bearded Collie is an energetic, boisterous breed that requires a fair amount of outdoor exercise. Unlike many of their owners, Beardies are happy to run and play outside no matter what the weather. They need some sort of activity every day, whether playing ball; a long walk, run, or hike; or just playing in a large, fenced-in yard or other area with a companion, human or canine. And, of course, being bred to herd sheep, Beardies love to participate in athletic events such as herding, rally, agility, and obedience competitions. A busy Beardie is a happy Beardie.","As with all dogs, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations between the ages of seven weeks and four months will help him develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult. Puppy training classes serve as part of the socialization process and help the owner learn to recognize and avert certain undesired behaviors that may be developing.

And while they are generally calm, Bergamascos have a good deal of energy and are happy to join their owners in almost any sort of activity, whether that entails retrieving a ball, going on a brisk walk or hike, or romping together in an open field.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations will help him develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult. The Bergamasco is a sociable, highly intelligent breed who possesses a deep desire to please his master. The breed thinks independently, however, and often sees itself more as an equal partner than as a subordinate to the members of his family. A Bergamasco who can be made to understand what is wanted of him, and why he should do it, will happily comply, if in his own way."

The rest of the year, a Picard only needs to be brushed once a month. The breed should be bathed only occasionally, and shampoos formulated for crisp coats are recommended. As with all breeds, the Picard's nails should be trimmed regularly.","Bred to work in the fields, the Berger Picard is active and athletic, with plenty of stamina and drive. This high-energy breed needs lots of daily exercise and mental stimulation. The Picard must have a good outlet for all his energy, or he may become destructive and unhappy. Owners should expect to go on at least one long walk every day. Picards also make excellent companions on hikes and bike rides, and they enjoy swimming and playing fetch. Many Picards participate in agility, tracking, obedience, Schutzhund (protection), flyball, French ring sport, rally, and herding competitions.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are a must. Training should begin as early as possible to prevent bad habits from developing. Picards have a stubborn streak, but they are very intelligent and eager to please, so training is usually fairly easy.

Bichons may experience early tooth loss or complications from gum infection if dental care and regular tooth brushing are not a priority. To avoid ear infections, regular ear cleaning is recommended.","Bichons should be brushed at least two or three times a week, but every day is best. They need a bath and a clipping at least once a month. Owners who show their Bichons learn to do this, but most pet owners take their Bichon to the groomer every four to six weeks. The Bichon is considered to be relatively hypoallergenic, as the breed sheds very little because the shed hair is caught up in the undercoat. That shed hair has to be brushed out to prevent mats from forming. As with all breeds, the Bichon's nails should be trimmed regularly as well.","The Bichon is classified as 'somewhat active,' but that's an average. Long stretches of calm are interspersed with brief bursts of high activity, often just running through the house or around the yard. Daily play sessions, in addition to walks, are required. Another dog can be a fine exercise companion, but the Bichon will still need quality playtime with his owner. A fenced-in backyard is a good idea; Bichons are surprisingly fast, and if one makes a dash for freedom, he may be difficult to catch or to call back to you. Many Bichons enjoy participating in obedience, agility, and rally competitions.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Bichons have a reputation for being difficult to housebreak. In every other respect, however, they are very easy to train. For example, Bichons love to perform tricks and learn new ones quickly.

Sensitive GI systems are common in the Biewer Terrier, so they may have an occasional soft or discolored stool. Although not life-threatening, if your dog has persistent problems with diarrhea or discolored stools, you should take him/her to the vet immediately. The Biewer Terrier is a relatively healthy dog, with no known excessive issues. That being said, we recommend the following tests for dogs before breeding.","The Biewer Terrier has a long coat that requires daily brushing. There is minimal matting with the silkier coat, but the soft coats may get some mats. If you choose to keep your Biewer in a short coat, minimal grooming is needed. Good-quality products are recommended to keep the coat in its soft, silky condition.



 Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your dog. Beyond regular brushing, the occasional bath will keep them clean and looking their best, again using good quality products. Their nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","The Biewer Terrier is a rather mellow, easy-going dog. Their playful attitudes provide them with a natural means of self-exercising, along with the time spent playing with their human families. Indoor activities could include hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or teaching them new tricks. Biewers are also excellent on walks, quite agile and love to go on outings. If you live in an apartment, even short walks in the hallways can give your dog some exercise, especially during inclement weather.","The Biewer's dedication and loyalty make them the perfect family pet.

Black and Tan Coonhounds are intelligent, affectionate, and devoted and also have an independent streak. They can be trained, but it's best to expect compliance rather than blind obedience. Once they learn to do something, they'll be inclined to do it that way for the rest of their lives, so it's important to train the behavior correctly the first time.

","Borzoi are generally healthy dogs,and a responsible breeder will screen breeding stock for health conditions such as elbow and hip dysplasia, osteochondritis dissecans, and progressive retinal atrophy. Like other large and deep-chested dogs, they can experience bloat, a sudden and life-threatening stomach condition. Owners should educate themselves as to what symptoms indicate this is occurring and what to do if so. Sighthounds, including Borzoi, are more sensitive to anesthesia than other breeds. As with all breeds, a Borzoi's ears should be checked regularly, and the teeth should be brushed often.","Like any long-coated dog, the Borzoi will shed a bit. In general, a quick brushing every day or two with a pin brush, slicker brush, and/or a comb will remove any loose hair and dirt from the coat. About once a year the Borzoi will shed more heavily for several weeks, and during this shedding season more frequent grooming is needed. Regular baths keep the Borzoi clean and looking his best. As with all breeds, the Borzoi's nails should be trimmed regularly.","Even though Borzoi are large, they are graceful, athletic animals who make good housedogs. They do need daily exercise, whether in the form of long walks or running in a securely fenced yard. Being sighthounds, they are apt to chase anything that moves, so they should always be in an enclosed area or on a leash. It is never advisable to allow a Borzoi to run loose. Borzoi enjoy doing activities with their owners and excel in canine sports such as agility and lure coursing.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Exposing the puppy to positive experiences with a wide variety of people, places, and situations will help him develop into a well-adjusted adult. Borzoi are intelligent and very affectionate with their owners, but are also independent and sometimes stubborn, so training may be a challenge. Patience and consistency are key. Overall they are usually gentle, well-mannered companions. Remember that Borzoi were bred to chase game, and any small animal that runs may trigger this response, so the breed should be on leash when on outings."

","Protecting the Boston Terrier's beautiful but prominent eyes is of special importance. The eyes should be checked daily for redness or irritation. Some owners carry saline eye drops to flush out dust or debris. Responsible breeders screen their stock for eye problems such as cataracts, corneal ulcers, and glaucoma, as well as deafness and patellar luxation (comparable to a ""trick knee"" in humans). Like all flat-faced breeds, Bostons can experience difficulty breathing when not given adequate shelter from excessive heat or humidity.","The Boston's sleek, fine coat does shed somewhat, though not a lot. Weekly brushing with a soft-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove will help to remove the loose hair. A good brushing also promotes new hair growth and distributes skin oils throughout the coat to help keep it healthy. Bostons need to be bathed only occasionally, unless they get into something messy. As with all breeds, the Boston's nails should be trimmed regularly, because overly long nails can cause the dog pain as well as problems walking and running.","The Boston's need for exercise varies from individual to individual. For some, a brisk walk once or twice a day will be enough. Others will need more time to run and play every day and let off steam. Simply letting a Boston out into the backyard doesn't count as exercise'¿he'll probably just sit at the door waiting to be let back in. Left alone for long periods of time, a Boston will tend to become frustrated and develop undesirable behaviors. Throw him a ball or a toy, however, and he'll be more than happy to play with you. Participation in canine sports such as agility, obedience, flyball, and rally is an enjoyable way to channel the breed's energy.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Socialization'¿gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations'¿will help him develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult. Treats make a great training incentive.

They are happiest when they stay busy. A bored Bouvier can be a very destructive one. They are an excellent fit for an active household with an owner who hikes or jogs or even bikes. The Bouvier needs a large, enclosed exercise area where he can romp and play, preferably with other dogs or kids who will keep him in good condition both mentally and physically. Heavy exercise should be limited while he is a growing puppy.","The Bouvier is happiest when he has a job to do, whether that job is babysitting, herding, obedience, or guard dog or rescue work. Bouviers are easily trained to do almost any type of dog sport or activity, and they usually excel at it. They have a strong prey drive so should be well socialized from the start.

The website of the breed's national parent club, the American Boxer Club, provides in-depth details about the breed's health and care.","The Boxer's short, shiny coat requires very little grooming. A good once-over with a rubber curry-brush or a hound glove once or twice a week should keep him looking his best. The Boxer tends to be a clean dog, needing a bath only occasionally.

They need ample exercise every day, on leash or in a securely fenced area. The Boxer must never be allowed to run loose. The breed's heritage as a chaser of wild game means that they spend a good deal of time jumping and leaping about'¿as young dogs, they are constantly in need of reminders to teach them to stay 'down.' Because the Boxer is a powerful, active, and playful dog, he may not be the best choice for a very frail adult, nor for a small child who could be overwhelmed by a well-meaning but bouncy puppy.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are vital in channeling the breed's energy and exuberance in a positive way. Boxers are highly intelligent, but can become bored with repetition. They tend to have a mind of their own and are excellent problem solvers. Not always tolerant of other dogs of the same sex, most Boxers of opposite sexes enjoy each other's company.

Bulldogs enjoy wading in very shallow water, but they should never be allowed in water that's more than elbow deep unless supervised closely.","Bulldogs are sweet, devoted, and easygoing, and they want to please their owner. As with all breeds, early socialization is vital to help give the dog a good start in life. Puppy training classes are highly recommended as well and allow the owner to learn how to curb any undesirable behaviors. Bulldogs love to chew'¿most will enjoy chew toys their entire life. They also love to play tug-of-war, but it is important to teach the dog when he is young to release what's in his mouth on command. From the start the young Bulldog should also be taught to accept having people take food from his bowl while he is eating, so that he does not develop a habit of being protective of his food."

","Bullmastiffs are a large breed with heavy bone. Breeders strive to adhere to the standard and to avoid overdone animals. In order to do the job of a guard dog, this working breed must be mentally and physically sound. Responsible Bullmastiff breeders support the American Bullmastiff Association Health & Research Committee, and screen their breeding stock for cardiac issues, hip and elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism and eye problems. Like many dogs, both purebred and not, Bullmastiffs can develop cancer as well as bloat, a sudden and life-threatening swelling of the abdomen; owners should educate themselves about its symptoms and what to do should bloat occur. Heredity and environment play roles in the health of the breed, so breeders and owners must work together in order to breed and raise healthy dogs.","Seasonal shedding is to be expected, though unusual hair loss should be noted as a possible problem. A balanced diet and a healthy environment are most important for coat health. Frequent grooming ensures that shedding can be managed, and dogs should be bathed as needed. The skin and coat should be monitored in order to ensure that dryness or oiliness are not issues. These can be related to diet, and sometimes to allergies.","Bullmastiffs enjoy daily exercise. Some are more sedentary, while others are very active by nature, but moderate exercise should be encouraged. Brisk walks and outdoor play are favorites of the breed, although secure fencing is a must for outdoor areas. Fencing is critical to ensure that the dog is safely contained and so strangers and unfamiliar animals do not intrude on the Bullmastiff's territory. Puppies should not be overexercised, especially during periods of rapid growth. Bullmastiffs are not the ideal breed for people who want a canine running partner, but they are great walking companions.","Early training and socialization are critical for Bullmastiff puppies. The breed can be quite strong willed, and dogs and owners will both benefit from training regimens instilled in puppyhood. Rules and routines should be put in place early and adhered to as dogs grow up. Many breeders will encourage new owners to enroll in local puppy classes in order to ensure that puppies are exposed to other dogs and that owners have access to training assistance and information. Bullmastiffs can excel in agility, obedience, rally, even scent work and tracking, so training should begin immediately and be a part of the lifelong bond between dog and owner."

","The Cardigan is in general a very healthy breed, and responsible breeders  will screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), and degenerative myelopathy. And as with any 'long and low' canine, one must be cognizant of potential back issues. Avoid letting the Cardigan jump down off the bed or couch, and stairs can also be a hazard. At the first sign of any distress or discomfort, see the vet right away. The sooner a problem is caught, the quicker the recovery.","A good brushing at least once a week should keep the Cardigan's coat healthy and looking its best. Keeping the hair trimmed on the bottom of the feet helps to reduce the amount of dirt that an animal can bring into the house every day. The nails should be kept trimmed as well. Some pet owners mistakenly feel they should have their dog trimmed short for the summer. When the coat of the Cardigan is correct for the breed, this isn't necessary. The correct coat has the essential characteristics to maintain proper body temperature, as long as conditions are normal. It should be noted, however, that a black dog will absorb more heat on a sunny day, and care should be taken to avoid overexposure during hot weather.","The Cardigan is noted for being a very adaptable dog. If you want to hike and go on adventures, they are all for that. Or if you want to watch TV and eat popcorn, no problem'¿the Cardigan is there for you. Cardigans thrive on regular socialization, so going for walks in the neighborhood is important for many reasons. It provides fun for both you and the dog, as well as much-needed exercise. When your Cardigan unexpectedly starts to do 'power runs' through the house and over the couch, it is his way of saying, ""Hey, mom, I really need to burn off some fun'¿let's go play ball!"" And, yes, most Cardigans are 'ball-o-holics.' Use that to your advantage. Remember to avoid jumping and stairs, which can cause back injury.","It cannot be stressed enough that early and regular socialization is of the utmost importance in the developing a happy, healthy Cardigan. Gently expose the pup to a wide range of people, places, and situations. This process goes on for a lifetime, but the rewards of a well-socialized dog are wonderful. Go to training classes, and let all members of the family participate. Don't tolerate inappropriate behavior, and don't hesitate to seek the help of a qualified trainer or behaviorist if there's a problem you can't correct. A little effort early on will reward you with a dog whom you and all who meet him will love."

They can have a bit of a 'terrier' temperament, so a firm but gentle hand is necessary when training. They can excel in obedience training and other canine sports."

","Responsible breeders consistently screen their breeding stock for inherited eye problems that are known to occur in the Chinese Crested, including progressive retinal atrophy, glaucoma, and primary lens luxation. Epilepsy occurs in the breed occasionally. Patellar luxation (slipped stifles) affects Cresteds, as it does most small breeds. Legg-Calve-Perthes disease has no DNA test to screen parents, but it does sometimes show up on X-ray.","You might think that the hairless variation of the Chinese Crested would require almost no grooming. After all, he has no hair. However, because his skin is exposed, the hairless Crested is prone to skin irritations, allergies, and sunburn. Careful grooming, including skin treatments specifically for your dog's skin type, sunscreen, and acne lotions are necessary to maintain a healthy pet. The Powderpuff version needs to be brushed daily to maintain his fluffy coat. The Powderpuff's coat is different than that of most other dogs. The undercoat is shorter than the longer overlay, which is the opposite of most haired breeds. This makes them easier to brush, but the coat can mat quickly.","The exercise needs of the Chinese Crested can usually be satisfied with daily short walks with his owner and play-sessions in his backyard. It is good for the Crested to exercise outdoors, but care must be taken to use either sunscreen or place protective clothing on him. These are tough little dogs who can be very competitive in canine sports.","The Chinese Crested loves to spend time with his owner. This makes him a great candidate for competitive sports such as agility, flyball, and obedience, and they make great therapy dogs. They also enjoy and do well at lure coursing. They have a very sensitive nature and must be trained with gentle patience. Harsh words and negative actions on your part can damage your relationship to the point that he will not be interested in learning further from you."

","There are some unusual and specific health concerns in the Chinese Shar-Pei breed. One of the major problem areas is the eyes; eye disorders including entropion, glaucoma, retinal dysplasia, and SARDS are known to occur in the breed. Other conditions that can occur include respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, immune-mediated, skin, and gastrointestinal disorders, and certain cancers. The website of the breed's national parent club, the Chinese Shar-Pei Club of America, provides detailed breed-health information for owners.","The Chinese Shar-Pei requires only minimal grooming. They need a bath only every month or so. Nails should be trimmed once a week, ideally using a grinder. The ears should be cleaned weekly, but don't overdo the products. The pup should be accustomed at a young age to having his ears cleaned regularly. Do not use cotton swabs, and do not use hydrogen peroxide. The best way to clean the ear canal is to ""float' debris out of the canal using an ear-cleaning solution. A wide variety of good solutions are available on the market and from the veterinarian.","Individual dogs Shar-Pei vary in their exercise needs. This is a very adaptable breed. They can do well with a very active owner, walking every day, or living in an apartment with a few short walks. The breed also exercises mind and body by participating in obedience, tracking, agility, rally, and other activities that can be enjoyed by dog and owner.","One breed expert says, 'Get a jump-start on basic obedience, and don't let the dog be the boss!' Shar-Pei are smart and willing, but sometimes they are stubborn and a bit too smart, thinking of new ways to do things you may not be thrilled with. If you teach them with love and consistency, however, they are a joy.

","The Chinook is a robust, healthy breed, but there are certain health conditions that it is prone to. These include hip dysplasia, cryptorchidism (the absence of one or both testes from the scrotum), gastrointestinal disorders, and allergies. Some Chinooks suffer from a condition called 'Chinook seizures,' although it is generally thought to be a movement disorder and not true seizures. As with all breeds, a Chinook's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often.","The Chinook's plush double coat is fairly easy to care for. Like all mammals, Chinooks shed a bit throughout the year. Weekly brushing will help to remove dirt and loose hair and keep the dog looking his best. Longer, daily brushing sessions will be required during shedding season, which generally occurs twice a year, but happens more often with spayed or neutered animals. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can be painful to the dog and cause problems walking and running.","While they often appear relaxed and mellow around the house, Chinooks have a tremendous amount of energy, and they thrive on exercise and play. Because they bond strongly with their owners, they make great companions on long walks, hikes, bicycle rides, and camping trips. They even enjoy swimming and boating with their human family. Of course, Chinooks were bred to pull sleds, so it's no surprise that they excel at sports such as sledding, skijoring, bikejoring, and scootering. Chinooks also enjoy participating in agility, obedience, rally, tracking, and lure coursing events.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended for all dogs and help to ensure that the Chinook grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion. Chinooks are easy to train using positive reinforcement techniques. Unlike most sledding breeds, they can be reliable off-leash. Chinooks, especially young ones, are enthusiastic and affectionate, and they tend to jump up and go face to face with human friends and family members unless they are trained early on not to do so. Because of his friendly, confident, outgoing personality, no amount of training will make a guard dog out of a Chinook."

","Health issues for the Chow Chow may include eyelid entropion, hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, allergies, and thyroid function. These issues may be minimized by health screening, responsible breeding, and regular health care and can be diagnosed and managed with veterinary care. Extensive and detailed information on the breed's health can be found on the website of the Chow Chow Club, Inc.","Both the rough- and smooth-coated Chows have a profuse double coat and require regular grooming. Thorough brushing at least twice per week and a monthly bath can keep the dog's skin and coat healthy. Be sure to immediately remedy any parasite issues, such as fleas or ticks. Include eye and ear care with each grooming, and trim nails regularly. Puppy coat and the coat around the head can become badly matted if not groomed regularly. Care must be taken to remove all mats and brush or comb through the undercoat. It is preferable to use a cool air dryer to thoroughly dry the Chow after a bath.","The Chow Chow is an active and alert dog with moderate exercise needs. The Chow requires daily walks and moderate play with toys, with minimal rough play or high-impact exercise. Avoid exercise during hot periods of the day, as the breed does not tolerate high heat or humidity well. A moderate-paced walk four or more times a day will help to keep Chow and owner happy and healthy, and doing activities together enhances the human-canine bond.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the Chow grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion. Patience and positive, consistent reinforcement are the keys to successful training. The Chow Chow is a very intelligent dog but can be stubborn. Harsh training methods are to be avoided in order to develop a trusting relationship. Patience, praise, and regular practice are the best tools to use with your Chow."

His ears should be regularly inspected for dirt or buildup of excess wax and cleaned if needed with soft gauze and an ear-cleaning solution'¿the dog's breeder or the veterinarian can recommend a good brand to use. The nails should be trimmed often if not worn down naturally, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort.","Moderate physical exercise and mental stimulation are essential to satisfy the Cirneco's intensely intelligent and inquisitive nature. He does best when he has a function, whether that means competing in the show ring or other canine events or being an interactive family member. He enjoys long walks and activities with his people. Because of his strong hunting instincts, he should not be allowed off lead in areas that are not securely enclosed, as he may not be able to resist the urge to run off after perceived prey. He does well with a fenced backyard where he can enjoy playtime with his owner, although he should not be just left alone outside with no attention for long periods, as he would be lonely and unhappy.","The Cirneco has a strong, independent temperament necessary for a hunter but is friendly and affectionate and makes an excellent family pet. They respond well to gentle methods of training and can be successfully trained for obedience, rally, agility, tracking, and of course the breed's historical reason for existence: hunting. Many Cirnechi especially enjoy lure coursing. Due to the breed's strong prey drive, care must be exercised when introducing the Cirneco to cats and small animals. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the Cirneco grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion."

","Clumbers are generally a healthy breed, although certain conditions are sometimes seen, including hypothyroidism (with side effects of skin and ear issues) and entropion or ectropion (eyelids that turn either in or out). Like many other large breeds, growing too rapidly can cause eosinophilic panosteitis in Clumber puppies'¿something they usually outgrow. Hip dysplasia also occurs in the breed. Because the Clumber body is quite long, they are also somewhat predisposed to intervertebral disc disease (cervical and thoracic). Immune mediated hemolytic anemia has been encountered in some Clumbers; all should avoid being treated with sulfa drugs.","As with all breeds with heavy, lowset ears, routine cleaning of the ears is a must to avoid ear infections. The heavy folds on the head require regular once-overs with a damp cloth. Wrinkles that are not kept dry can easily set up a yeast infection that has a bad odor and is unpleasant for the dog. Nails should be kept short with monthly trims. Bathing once a month is usually sufficient for a dog who isn't working regularly in the field. Clumbers don't require a lot of trimming; their coat is very easy care, requiring little more than a thorough grooming with a brush and a medium comb once or twice a week.","Despite their lumbering appearance, the Clumber can be a very active dog. They will benefit from long walks, taking occasional breaks to sniff around. Clumbers love to retrieve, so they can get ample exercise right in their own backyard, chasing after a tennis ball and enjoying time spent with their owner.","The Clumber is steady and reliable, thorough and tenacious. These traits can sometimes make them a challenge to train, because they tend to stop and think things through before deciding to do them. Keep training sessions interesting to keep their attention on learning instead of searching for something more fun to do. Most will require a reason to do as they are told. They do not take well to a heavy-handed trainer, however."

","The Cocker Spaniel's national parent club, the American Spaniel Club, has a health committee that looks at breed health issues and makes recommendations to breeders for required health testing.The Cocker Spaniel has good longevity. A conscientious breeder can furnish records of the sire's and dam's health testing, for example for hips, patellas, and eyes. Breeders often have years of data regarding testing done in these health areas. Learn from the veterinarian proper procedures to clean the Cocker's ear canals on a regular basis, especially following a bath, in order to avoid infections. Thorough grooming of the Cocker coat will aid in preventing mats, which can precipitate skin problems underneath.","Cocker Spaniels require regular, thorough grooming. Sessions missed are not easily made up and may result in tangles or mats in the Cocker's coat. A metal, professional-quality dog comb with fine and medium spacing for the teeth is a necessity. You can follow combing with a gentle slicker brush, but the comb is key. Loose hair should be carefully removed with the comb, making sure you are clear and can see through to the skin everywhere. If you encounter snarls, do not pull through; rather, pick snarls apart, starting at the tips of the coat and then comb through. Be cautious when combing ears; the skin at the edges is thin and can be pierced by too-vigorous combing. The Cocker requires thorough bathing with quality dog shampoo. Thorough rinsing and re-rinsing are crucial, as soap residue can cause skin irritation. Dry carefully with a blow-dryer on not too hot a setting. Learn the procedure for cleaning and drying the ear canals. During bathing, check the Cocker's skin for any inflamed spots and get treatment. It is key to learn grooming procedures yourself and/or enlist the services of a professional groomer who likes and is experienced in grooming the breed.","The Cocker Spaniel is a sporting breed and should maintain good muscle tone, although the breed is not one that needs a lot of exercise for the purpose of discharging an abundance of energy. Cockers often enjoy getting their exercise by means of retrieving a ball or other toy, or accompanying their people on a walk. They very much enjoy spending time with their people, so walking is a good exercise option. If the Cocker has a canine companion, they can play to exercise each other. The Cocker Spaniel wants to please people and enjoys play, so these are tools you can use to encourage exercise.","Regarding training the Cocker Spaniel, the good news is that in general this is a people-pleasing breed. They want to be 'good' in order to please their people, and they are generally sensitive and responsive to correction and a disapproving tone in their owner's voice. Harsh means of correction are not usually warranted, nor are they productive in the Cocker. The breed enjoys the challenge of performance activities, and it is a good idea to try out the available activities and events to see what interests your individual Cocker and follow through with training. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Cockers are rather easily motivated with food rewards and with play and praise."

","The Collie Health Foundation has invested lots of research dollars to identify and solve health issues, and their website offers great information on health issues in the breed. The minimum requirement is for puppies between 6-8 weeks old to have an eye check by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist for Collie eye anomaly, an inherited eye disease. Some Collies may also have a sensitivity to certain drugs, known as the MDR1 mutation. More information can be found on this at http://vcpl.vetmed.wsu.edu. Collies typically live from 12 to 14 years and are as a rule healthy, but after doing their research prospective buyers should ask questions of breeders and have an understanding of what health guarantees can be provided.","Smooth Collies, while they won't mat, require regular grooming, as they have a double coat, and the undercoat needs brushing out during shedding periods. Rough Collies need attention to avoid matting, especially in certain areas such as behind the ears and elbows, and to remove loose undercoat. A weekly brushing down to the skin eliminates that problem and keeps the coat and skin healthy. If females are spayed, they do a big shed once a year; if intact, females shed about three months after their heat cycle, and males around their birthday, so those times require a little extra grooming.","While there are variations among individuals and families, Collies generally are quite active and require regular exercise. They need aerobic exercise and the chance to be able to run and play. Teaching them to fetch can provide good exercise, and having a fenced yard where they can run and going on daily walks help too. They should not be relegated to the backyard for long periods of time, as with boredom comes barking. Collies are people dogs and want to be with their owners first and foremost. Ideally a Collie will be ready to go when it's time to go, and able to chill when it's time to chill.","While Collies are very smart and easy to train, puppy classes are recommended for general socialization and training. But it shouldn't end there. Collies love training and learning, and both make for a better companion and build a good relationship with the owner and family. Collies thrive on positive teaching methods. They excel in obedience, agility, and herding, and even barn hunt and lure coursing, and owners will discover something fun to do with their dog!"

","The Coton de Tulear has remained fairly free of genetic health issues. That is not to say that they do not exist, but that any incidences are of an extremely low percentage. In the Coton, known incidences are usually in the one- to five-percent range. Coton breeders are working diligently to keep the breed as problem free as possible by doing genetic screening of all breeding stock. Occasionally eye problems and hip dysplasia do occur in the breed. As with all small breeds, there is a chance of luxating patellas, and spinal disc disease has been known to occur.","Grooming the Coton puppy is a breeze. During that time you should groom him regularly and ensure that he learns to see grooming sessions as positive times of bonding with his person. Unless you are going to keep your Coton in a short 'puppy clip,' your dog will require a great deal of brushing. You must be careful to get your comb and brush all the way to the skin (gently) during daily brushing, or the hair next to the skin will mat and if this is too extensive your dog may need to be shaved down. You should use a spray conditioner while brushing to avoid breakage. A couple of times a week, check the ears and remove any excess hair, wax, or debris to avoid ear infections.","The Coton is a fairly active dog who requires a moderate amount of exercise. Daily walks with his human at a slow speed will keep him in good weight and condition. Chasing a tennis ball around his backyard can keep his mind active as well as his body. A bored and unhappy Coton can become destructive. He does best when provided with enough exercise, lots of attention from his owner, and plenty of interesting toys to keep him occupied.","The Coton is an alert dog and naturally territorial. Cotons should be well socialized from an early age so that they will enjoy going with you wherever you go. Obedience training is a good idea, for socialization as well as reinforcing lessons and manners. A bored Coton will be unable to learn anything. Keep your training sessions lively and entertaining for best results. Cotons respond poorly to negative training practices but will excel in most dog-sport activities when trained with positive methods.

","The majority of Curlies are a healthy breed. Breeders have been very diligent about screening hips, eyes, and the heart. There are some cancer concerns. The breed is also susceptible to gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV), a life-threatening stomach condition also known as bloat. Owners must be aware of the symptoms and take quick action if it occurs.","Curlies do not have an undercoat, and the females will usually shed a fair amount of coat approximately every six months. Females may look relatively bare when not in coat. During shedding season a rake-type grooming tool with metal prongs is good at removing the dead hair, then the coat can be scissored down. The majority of owners never brush a Curly-Coated Retriever, as then the coat frizzes. A wet-down and air-dry is easy to do and often will enhance the curls.

As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly.","Curlies do need a fair amount of exercise but are also wonderful about settling down and relaxing at home. Their home does not need to be a large one as long as they are with their owner and have adequate exercise. The breed is very easy to live with as long as they have been shown their ""good manners"" with basic training. They love to be outside, yet they are very happy to spend time indoors at home with their people. They are not a breed who is good at being left alone for long periods of time.","The owner of a Curly-Coated Retriever needs to be firm but kind in training of the dog. Too rough, and they will turn tail; too soft or unclear, and they will not pay attention. They are an intelligent breed and smart enough to need an owner who is smarter than they are. Two things are helpful to remember regarding training a Curly: First, avoid too much repetition, as the dog may become bored and lose interest. Also, it is important for an owner to try to make the learning situation as much fun as possible. The goal is to make it so that the Curly enjoys what is being taught. Some Curlies do very well in the obedience ring, but for some the repetition of some of the exercises can cause disinterest. Training for fieldwork takes a knowledgeable approach and should not be rough. When new to the breed and interested in starting field training, find a training group in your area with whom you can train, and observe their methods before deciding to join."

",Czechoslovakian Vlcaks are a very healthy and robust breed. It is wise to ask the breeder what health concerns they have seen in each genetic line.,"Czechoslovakian Vlcaks have a weather resistant coat; it naturally cleans itself of mud and dirt. They seldom need a bath and have little to no body odor. They shed twice-a-year and at that time daily brushing is required. The winter coat is thicker, heavier and longer than the shorter, thinner summer coat and this may require more grooming during the colder months of the year. Their strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","This breed is known for having boundless energy, especially during puppyhood and young adolescence. Daily long walks/runs combined with mental stimulation work well. Turning them out into the back yard by themselves does not work. A Vlcak does best when they have a 'meaningful' job they can devote themselves to. They like to have an interactive experience with their owners. Activities like swimming, hiking, retrieving balls or flying discs can provide a good outlet for expending energy. A CSV may have prey drive towards small animals, so fenced enclosures and/or on-leash are always a good idea.","The Czechoslovakian Vlcak is a primitive breed of dog with a dominant and independent personality and so requires a different approach to training. Consistency and patience is a must. The CSV is confident, lively, active, high stamina, high energy, tough and obedient with quick reactions. They are also highly intelligent, versatile and curious. Early socialization and training is very important. With proper training, Vlcaks can excel in many different types of activities, but they need to see a purpose for the desired task. They bore very easily, do not like to do repetitive tasks and often refuse to perform the tasks regardless of treat incentives. Positive reinforcement training methods are highly recommended.

Like most dogs with drop ears, Dachshunds can get ear infections if their ears aren't kept clean.","Dachshunds are moderate shedders, relatively clean, and have little or no body odor. The breed's grooming needs vary with the three coat types. Smooth-coated Dachshunds are somewhat 'wash and wear,' needing little beyond a wipe with a towel or hound glove to look dapper. Longhaired Dachshunds may require more frequent brushing, depending on the thickness of the coat. The Wirehaired coat can be plucked or hand-stripped several times a year to look its best, but beyond that is easy to maintain between groomings with occasional trimming of the beard and eyebrows and brushing or combing once or twice a week. All Dachshunds should have their nails trimmed every month.","Many owners think that because they are so small, Dachshunds don't require more exercise than just running around the house. However, they do need regular exercise not only to stay fit, but also to build strong muscles to support and protect their back. Two walks every day of moderate length should be sufficient. To avoid injury, never allow your Dachshund to run up and down stairs or jump on or off furniture. Because they are very social, Dachshunds don't do well as outdoor dogs'¿they want to be with their humans.","Dachshunds are very intelligent but are also independent and often stubborn, so they can be a challenge to train. They love to give and receive affection and do best with positive, reward-based training. They are sensitive and will not react well to harsh commands or punishment. Patience and consistence are key. Dachshunds have an excellent sense of smell as well as a strong prey drive. Because they were bred to stay focused and follow a trail without distraction, if they are busy with something more interesting they may not always pay attention to you."

","If your Dalmatian came from a reputable breeder, you will have a record of genetic health testing done on the parents. Deafness is present in the breed, and responsible breeders will have had the parents tested and will have entire litters tested to be certain that all can hear.

Kidney stones are also present in Dals. Your breeder or vet can tell you what you should feed to avoid the problem. Usually quite healthy, Dalmatians aren't picky eaters and don't require a lot of supplements to keep them looking fit.","The Dalmatian's coat is a thing of beauty with its colored spots on a sparkling white background, and it doesn't take much work to keep it in good condition.

This exercise can consist of chasing a ball tossed across the backyard, running alongside a biking or jogging owner, or taking a nice, long hike through the woods. Since a puppy's bones and joints aren't at their mature strength until two years of age, be wary of strenuously exercising the dog before then. Dalmatians can be very high-energy dogs and can easily get into mischief if they don't have enough opportunity for physical and mental exercise.","It is very important that you expose your puppy to as many new and unusual but pleasant situations as possible as part of his training. If he understands that new places and people are nothing to be afraid of, it will not only make his life happier but will make life with him much easier for you. He should be taught to behave from the very beginning, but Dalmatians can be very sensitive, so positive, reward-based training is a must.

Most Dandies will do very well in a home environment with moderate exercise.

","In broad strokes, the Drent is a healthy breed. Certainly, some individuals may suffer from any canine malady, but that isn't representative across the breed as a common issue or health concern.


From a genetic standpoint, the Drent has only a few hereditary diseases to know about and monitor in order to keep incidences low. The Drent's eyes should be monitored for the following hereditary diseases: Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA), Distichiasis, Entropion and Ectropion, Persistent Pupillay Membranes (PPM), and Retinal Dysplasisa.


Other diseases or abnormalities which have been found in the Drent are: The most common, but usually non-problematic, is von Willebrand disease type-I (vWD-I). Despite a high incidence rate of carriers and affected dogs in the population. To date there have been no Drents that have shown clinical sign of the disease. This means affected dogs (dogs with two copies of the gene), do not have an abnormal bleeding response. Von Willebrand disease type-I is detectable by DNA health panels. While the disease is of interest, it is not considered to be a threat for the Drent.


Amongst breed authorities, Epilepsy is considered to be the greatest current health threat to the Drent. The type of Epilepsy has not been determined. There are a several research projects underway, no results have been produced to date. There is no genetic testing available for this in the Drent. Occurrence/manifestation is uncommon.


Other health issues that can be present: hypothyroidism, cryptorchidism, hyperuricosuria, significant reactions to poisonous insect bites/stings and the absence of certain teeth. Like many breeds, hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia should be monitored and all breeding stock screened for. Joint dysplasia is influenced by genetics and environment, so using care during the Drents' rapid growth period is advisable.","The coat of the Drent is considered the be 'half-long', meaning hair on the body is short of a full curl to nearly flat, but has feathering on the neck, back of all legs, and a brushy tail. Drents have a single coat, similar to a Field-Line Setter or Brittany and shed twice per year.


Usually, a weekly grooming session will handle everything well, and prevent your Drent from needing to be bathed, unless of course they get into something odorous. The Drent¿s coat is not oily or sebaceous and their coat texture is fine, so the regular brushing serves to keep them dirt and dander free. The ear it the most difficult part of Drent maintenance. You should be prepared to strip off overgrowth so that the natural shape of the ear leather is easy to see. Check ears and nails weekly.


Managing the seasonal change  is generally handled with ease with the proper use of a Mars coat rake, a comb, followed by a pin brush, finished with a boar bristle brush to polish up the coat.","Drents are intelligent hunting dogs in need of stimulation and regular exercise, regardless of the weather. They are wonderful hiking partners, but also suitable for canicross, or any of the 'joring' sports. The Drent also would be good for agility, or other 'action' sport where mind and body are engaged. This breed is not suitable for sedentary lifestyles.","Drents are intelligent hunting dogs in need of mental stimulation and regular exercise, regardless of the weather.

A long-toothed metal dog comb can also come in handy for gently working through areas where tangles may be beginning to form. Left unattended, tangles and mats are uncomfortable for your dog and can cause skin problems to develop. Regular trimming around the face, feet, and other areas can keep your English Setter looking neat. Nails should be trimmed once a month, and a bath every four to six weeks keeps the English Setter's coat and skin clean and healthy.","An English Setter needs regular exercise to stay happy and healthy. Ideally this could be a daily vigorous run or play session in a large, securely fenced area. Many owners don't have access to such an area, however, so they may ride a bicycle with their English Setter alongside on a leash, jog with him, or take him for long walks or hikes. Because their bones and joints may not reach mature strength until two years of age, it's best to avoid very strenuous or high-impact activity with puppies and young dogs. Even though they are energetic athletes when outdoors, English Setters will usually settle right down as quiet companions in the home after their daily run or walk.","English Setters are sensible, good-natured, and devoted companions. They are very sensitive and take reprimands to heart, so it's best to teach them with positive reinforcement rather than punishment. Their keen nose and prey drive can lead them to follow their instincts'¿but this can get them into trouble, so it's important to start training early and be consistent. As puppies they're especially curious about everything, so remember to keep valuable or dangerous items out of reach. When given the attention, training, and exercise he needs, an English Setter is wonderfully companionable and pleasantly manageable in the home."

","Eurasiers were bred to be robust and sturdy. In general, they are a healthy breed. Breeding is subject to thorough testing to minimize health problems. Diseases that can occur in the breed are hip dysplasia, patellar luxation, distichiasis, thyroid conditions, EPI, and gastric torsion. The parent club requires health testing of all breeding dogs prior to mating and encourages testing of offspring to gain as much health information as possible on the breed.","To keep them clean and happy, Eurasiers need a once-a-week to bi-weekly thorough combing/brushing with body checks for burrs or pests; a cleaning of their eyes, ears and a check of their pads; and occasional nail clippings, if needed (especially their dewclaws).They have little body odor and require infrequent bathing. Typically, Eurasiers shed their entire undercoat once or twice a year for a period of about 3 weeks. During undercoat shedding periods, daily combings/brushings are required to minimize picking up 'wool' balls from around the house. If Eurasiers are spayed or neutered their coats can become much thicker, longer and harder to manage.","Eurasiers should have good daily walks and active play with other dogs. Off-leash walks are preferred once trained and reliable to recall. Some Eurasiers like to swim and others enjoy agility or obedience. Some also work as therapy dogs. While they are calm in the house, they are active and energetic while outside.","Eurasiers are good-natured, but can be reserved towards strangers. This can be largely overcome with proper socialization. They are very loyal to their family, willing-to-please and good to train, although they can show some independence. The Eurasier is a sensitive dog that does not require harsh reprisals; rather, gentle affection, love and understanding provide its incentive to learn. Training must be interesting for the dog and not repetitive as he gets easily bored. The Eurasier is a very social dog that must be included as part of the family.

","Fortunately, thanks to thoughtful breeding, Finnish Spitz in the U.S. and Canada are a generally healthy breed and don't present many health issues. Responsible breeders screen potential breeding stock for patella, elbows, hips, and eyes, with the numbers of affected dogs very low. New owners are urged to have a conversation with their breeders about care for growing puppies, including the need to limit vigorous exercise, and avoiding early spay and neuter until maturity (3'¿5 years) is reached.","The Finnish Spitz is a ""natural"" breed that some owners refer to as ""wash and wear."" The breed standard is very specific: ""No trimming of the coat except for feet is allowed. Whiskers shall not be trimmed. Any alteration of the coat by coloring, dying, trimming, scissoring or other means must be severely faulted."" Lightly spraying the coat with water and brushing the coat using a pin brush every two to three days is adequate. Hot blow-drying will dry the outer coat. During their twice-yearly shedding season, daily brushing or a bath followed by a cool-temperature blow-dry and brushing will speed up this process, and a good quality comb and a slicker brush are very useful in getting out the undercoat. The shedding is more severe in an intact female. The coat of a spayed female can become softer and denser and can take more grooming.","Finnish Spitz were bred to hunt all day in dense woods, giving them the stamina to range far, making a solidly fenced yard a must. A Finnish Spitz must never be kept away from his people, as he becomes deeply bonded with his family. They require a moderately high degree of exercise.

","Most German Shepherds are healthy dogs. A responsible breeder will screen breeding stock for health conditions such as degenerative myelopathy and elbow and hip dysplasia. German Shepherd Dogs can experience bloat, a sudden and life-threatening swelling of the abdomen, and owners should educate themselves about its symptoms and what to do should bloat occur.","The German Shepherd Dog has a medium-length, double coat consisting of a dense, harsh, and close-lying outer coat with a softer undercoat. The breed is easy to maintain, usually requiring just a quick brushing every few days or so to help remove loose hairs, but they do shed more profusely once or twice a year. During these periods, more frequent brushing will help control the amount of hair that ends up around the house and on the furniture. The German Shepherd only needs an occasional bath. It is important to trim or grind his nails every month if they are not worn down naturally, as overly long nails can cause pain and structural issues.","As a very active and athletic breed, the German Shepherd requires lots of exercise for his physical and mental well-being. A dog who is not exercised enough will become frustrated and likely to develop undesirable behaviors. With a puppy, you can start with short daily walks, as well as play sessions in a safely fenced area. Remember to not let the dog off leash, as even the best-trained dog can become distracted and not follow every command. Participating in canine activities such as agility, herding, tracking, and dock diving provides excellent physical and mental exercise and is fun and rewarding for both dog and owner.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are vital, and continuing obedience training will help ensure that the pup will grow to be an adaptable and well-mannered adult. The German Shepherd is a highly intelligent companion and an extraordinary worker. Consistency and positive, reward-based training will yield excellent results. He is extremely bonded to his people, so he is happiest when he lives with his family. He should be raised in the household and exposed to the family's activities.

Among these are hip dysplasia, eye conditions such as progressive retinal atrophy, and certain heart diseases. A responsible breeder will screen their breeding stock for conditions that affect the breed. GSPs can also be affected by bloat, a life-threatening condition where the stomach suddenly distends and often twists as well. Owners should educate themselves as to what symptoms indicate this is occurring and what to do should it occur.","The GSPs coat is easy to groom most of the year, requiring only a good once-over with a brush or grooming glove every few days. Although the coat is short, it still sheds'¿especially at certain times of the year, when more frequent brushing will be needed to remove the loose hairs before they end up all over the house. The hairs can become embedded in fabrics and carpet and hard to get out. An occasional bath (using a gentle shampoo) can help. The ears should be regularly inspected and cleaned, and the nails trimmed short.","The GSP does best with plenty of exercise and things to do, such as running, swimming, and dog sports'¿in fact, anything that will burn some of their boundless energy while spending time outdoors with a human buddy. Their routine should ideally include ample physical activity twice a day. This might be in the form of brisk, half-hour walks morning and evening or running and playing in a securely fenced area. GSPs are smart and athletic and excel in a wide range of canine activities that exercise mind and body, from field eventsto agility, obedience, and dock diving.","Early training is essential for the German Shorthaired Pointer. Socializationand puppy training classes are vital, continuing with practice in basic obedience commands. This is an intelligent breed that learns quickly with consistent training sessions. GSPs need a purpose, and without one they can be destructive if left to their own devices. The breed can be extremely challenging from 6 months to 3 years old. GSPs have a very high energy level and a strong prey drive, and they need an owner with an active lifestyle to guide the dog's exuberance and intensity into positive outlets."

","Some cases of PRA (Progressive Retinal Atrophy), RD (Retinal Dysplasia), and Patella Luxation have been seen in the German Spitz, but a majority of this breed are generally healthy. Puppies should be bought only from responsible breeders who eye test their breeding stock. Working with a reputable breeder, prospective owners can gain the education they need to learn about specific health concerns within the breed.","The German Spitz has a profuse double coat, which sheds twice per year. During those times, the entire undercoat is shed in the span of about 2 to 3 weeks. Daily brushing will be required to remove his old coat and his hair will inevitably be all over your clothes, furniture and floor. The good news is his shedding is quite minimal during the rest of the year. A quick brush every couple days and a thorough grooming once per week will suffice to keep mats and knots from forming. His hair should never be clipped off entirely, as you will remove the insulating properties of his coat. He also does not need to be bathed very often. Mud can be brushed out of his coat if allowed to dry first.","A moderate amount of regular exercise will suffice for the German Spitz. Though longer activity is unnecessary, he will happily keep up on an extended walk. Providing a secure area for exercise is highly recommended as he is a very curious dog and can wiggle through the smallest of gaps in search for other adventures. Ponds are also a hazard to this breed and should be fenced off. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or teaching him new tricks. If you live in an apartment, even short walks in the hallways can give your dog some exercise, especially during inclement weather.



 Equally important is not to let your German Spitz become too bored. He is a lively and intelligent breed and, if left with nothing to do all day, he may become destructive or excessively bark.","Highly intelligent, the German Spitz learns quickly and is eager to please with motivational methods. He does not respond well to being made to do things however. One behavioral characteristic you may want to curb with training is his natural reaction to bark at anything new or unusual. Bred to be an alert watchdog, he is naturally very vocal, but this should not be allowed to become a problem. Your neighbors will not thank you for it either. With good training, this breed can excel at mini agility heelwork to music and obedience."

The Giant must be brushed weekly, and clipped or stripped regularly to maintain a healthy and attractive coat. The owner should be prepared to spend time maintaining the coat or plan to have the dog periodically groomed by the breeder or someone whom the breeder recommends. The Giant's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste formulated for dogs.","More energetic and up-tempo than most big breeds, Giants need lots of exercise. Long daily walks, play sessions with another dog, or romps in the yard with their owners will do nicely. Giants are great workout companions for people who run, bicycle, hike, cross-country ski, swim, or skijor. All of these activities require a very active partnership with the owner. The Giant needs companionship either in the form of a human he can play with, or another large dog.

These include hip dysplasia and eye disease such as cone rod dystrophy. Responsible breeders will screen their stock for conditions the breed can be prone to. Caution should be taken to avoid unnecessary stress on the front legs during their first nine months of life. As with all breeds, the Glen's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs.","The Glen of Imaal Terrier's weather-resistant double coat, consisting of a rough outer coat and a soft undercoat, requires moderate brushing weekly to prevent matting of the furnishings (the soft hair around the ears, neck, legs and belly) and should also be stripped two or three times a year. They shed very little as a result of this effort. It does not take a great amount of time, and the bonding you achieve with your pup is well worth the time involved. Since Glens are a dwarf breed, a small but sturdy grooming table is a very good investment. It will make the process much easier on both of you. The nails should be trimmed regularly, and the ears checked weekly for debris or excess wax buildup.","A little more laid-back than the typical terrier, Glens require moderate exercise to stay healthy and happy. As a dwarf breed with slightly curved front legs, Glens should not be rushed into strenuous exercise such as long walks on leash'¿it's good to start leash training, but keep the walks short and fun. A small handful of the pup's regular kibble can be used to reward him for staying close while on leash. Let him run around the house or a fenced yard, perhaps chasing a toy or ball. He will flop down for a rest when he has had enough. Owners should prevent puppies from jumping off couches, going down steep stairs, or engaging in anything that might put undue stress on their growing front legs and joints. Pups need time for the growth plates in their legs to close before they do any jumping or start climbing or descending stairs. Going down stairs is more stressful on the front legs than going up. Some breeders have pups avoid stairs and jumping as much as possible until they are at least 9 months of age, as the growth plates will close sometime between 9 and 12 months. This is a normal part of the developmental process but especially important in dwarf breeds whose legs are short in relation to their body weight.","Glens are versatile, trainable, and very smart. They love people but normally won't get chummy with other dogs. They are quieter and less spiky than other terriers'¿but, still, they're terriers: brave, sometimes stubborn, and keenly interested in the doings of small furry critters, their natural prey. Like most terriers, they have a great deal of character and learn quickly, which can make training a joy, although they may get bored with repetition. Positive reinforcement is the key.

Most of the time, a good brushing-out with a slicker brush once or twice a week will remove much of the dead hair before it has a chance to fall onto the furniture. During times of heavy shedding, these brushing sessions turn into daily affairs. Baths help to loosen the dead hairs, but the dog must be completely dry before brushing begins. Otherwise, Goldens only need occasional baths to keep them clean. As with all breeds, the Golden's nails should be trimmed regularly.","Like most Sporting breeds, Goldens need plenty of daily exercise. A Golden who doesn't get enough exercise is likely to engage in undesirable behavior. Goldens make great companions on long runs and bike rides, although consultation with a vet is recommended before starting strenuous or high-impact activities that might cause stress to the dog's bones and joints. Many Goldens happily get their exercise on hunting trips or at field trials, as well as by participating in canine sports such as agility, obedience, and tracking.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended.

Bathing monthly is recommended. Dry skin and dandruff can be prevented with bathing and conditioning.","Gordons were bred to be personal hunting dogs, and they also served as nannies. They live to cuddling by your side or at your feet, as well as running in a field. Their genetic makeup calls for them to have a drive to run, so they do need exercise. They can live in an apartment but if so, they need daily exercise, which can be met by walking, jogging, or biking with the dog. If they have a yard in which to run, they will self-exercise, though a Gordon will always be happiest doing something with their bonded owner. Being with their owner is what they live to do. Caution: To prevent bloat, never exercise the dog one-half hour before or one-half hour after feeding.","A few, simple lifesaving training commands are mandatory. A puppy or dog must be trained to know the command 'come,' and to come when called; to know his name and respond; and to obey the word 'no.' Gordons are stubborn yet very soft and loving, and they live to please their owner.

","Greyhounds are overall very healthy dogs, although there are a few conditions the breed can be prone to. As are most deep-chested breeds, the Greyhound is susceptible to bloat and gastric torsion, a sudden and life-threatening enlargement of the stomach that is sometimes accompanied by twisting. Owners should be aware of the symptoms of bloat and seek medical attention immediately if they occur. A condition called Greyhound neuropathy seems to be isolated in the breed. Other disorders that can occur include cardiac and eye conditions. Responsible breeders screen their stock for conditions that can affect the breed.","The Greyhound's short, smooth coat requires little grooming beyond regular baths and weekly rubdowns with a damp cloth or hound glove. His strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly if not worn down naturally, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort. The ears should be checked at least weekly for any buildup of wax or debris that could result in an infection, and cleaned if needed. The teeth should be brushed regularly'¿daily if possible'¿with a toothpaste formulated for dogs.","The Greyhound is the cheetah of the dog world. While perfectly happy to lounge around the house all day, he is capable of amazing speed and energy when faced with potential prey'¿or the chance to chase a tennis ball or a coursing lure. Greyhounds require a regular schedule of exercise time and opportunities to (safely) run full-out. They must only be allowed off leash in a securely fenced area, as they may not be able to resist the urge to run off in pursuit of perceived prey.","Training a Greyhound can be frustrating for anyone who does not understand the genetic origins of the Greyhound temperament. As a sighthound, or coursing breed, the Greyhound was developed to pursue game by sight rather than by scent. They course game independently of humans, making decisions on their own, unlike other types of hunting breeds that require a bit of direction. A Greyhound should be socialized from an early age with small animals and children. Keep training lessons short and sweet, as the Greyhound will become bored very easily. With his mild, sensitive personality, he needs a gentle approach in training, never harsh. Greyhounds are more interested in doing things *with* you than *for* you. They are very affectionate with their families, though they tend to be reserved with strangers."

","As a breed, Hamiltonstovare are very healthy and rarely diagnosed with inheritable diseases. Hamiltonstovare can get hip dysplasia and epilepsy, but it rarely happens. Care should be taken to not over-exercise them before their growth plates have closed. They are also sensitive to heat and cannot be outside for long periods of time in temperatures over 80 degrees.",Hamiltons require very little grooming and are very easy to keep clean. They are seasonal shedders that only shed low to moderately in the spring and fall. Hamiltonstovare also do not drool and rarely have a doggy odor. A bath once a month and proper nail and dental care are all that are required to keep them looking their best.,"Hamiltonstovare are an active breed but they do have an off switch. They are ready to warm the sofa one day and go for a 10 mile hike the next. Daily, they need at least a 20 minute free-run outside and also something to stimulate their mind. They are a highly intelligent breed that thrives on being with their people and doing things that make their people happy. They are hounds and will follow their nose so a securely fenced yard is recommended.","Hamiltonstovare are a highly perceptive breed and adore their people. They make excellent service dogs, especially for medical alerts and psychological alerting. They are also wonderful family dogs and generally get along with everybody and everything. Hamiltons do have a high prey drive though, so they may not be the best dog for homes with rodents or even some cats as pets.

The Hanoverian Scenthound should be provided with enough space to roam and play. He has a great stamina and will make a willing hiking, camping or jogging companion.","Training a Hanoverian Scenthound can be challenging because of its independent nature.

Responsible breeders test their stock for conditions the breed can be prone to and communicate with other dedicated breeders regularly, working together for breed health and the preservation of the breed's qualities. A Harrier's ears should be checked weekly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs.

A weekly brushing with a soft-bristle brush or a hound glove will help to remove dirt and loose hair and keep the dog looking his best, and an occasional bath(using a gentle shampoo) can help keep him from having a doggy odor. The ears should be regularly inspected and cleaned if needed with soft gauze and an ear-cleaning solution'¿the dog's breeder or the veterinarian can recommend a good brand to use. The nails should be trimmed often if not worn down naturally, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort and problems walking and running.","Harriers were bred specifically to spend hours in the field chasing after prey, so they need ample exercise every day'¿without sufficient exercise, a Harrier may become bored and destructive. If they get all the activity they need, they can be adaptable to a range of home situations. While they are happiest living indoors with their human family, they make great companions on long walks or hikes. Because they were bred to hunt and chase animals and to follow a scent, they should only be allowed loose in areas that are securely fenced, and any walks must be taken on a leash. The breed also exercises mind and body by participating in canine sports such as tracking, rally, coursing ability tests, and other activities that can be enjoyed together by dog and owner.","Like many other hounds, Harriers are loving and amiable but also tend to have an independent nature, and they can be stubborn. Training takes consistency, patience, and an understanding of scent hound temperament. They respond well to calm, loving, but firm leadership. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the Harrier grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion."

","Havanese are generally healthy and fairly long-lived. There are several conditions that the breed can be prone to, including eye disorders, chondrodysplasia, deafness, heart murmurs, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (which affects the hip joint), and patellar luxation. A responsible breederdoes health clearances on all breeding stock. The Havanese Club of Americapresents awards for members' dogs passing and registering Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) results for at least four specific health tests for the breed: an annual eye exam (CAER), a hearing test (BAER), a hip x-ray, and patella (knee) certification.","The long, soft, and silky coat of the Havanese needs to be groomed daily to be kept free of mats and tangles. This can be done by gently running a comb or soft brush over the dog while he is on your lap. Pet owners often choose to have their dog's coat clipped to a short trim to reduce grooming time. The Havanese should also be bathed occasionally as needed. The corners of the eyes should be gently cleaned daily to prevent tear-stain of the lighter-colored hair in the area. Check the ears often to remove excess wax or accumulated debris, and wipe out the inside of the ear-flap with a slightly moistened gauze or paper towel.","The Havanese has moderate exercise needs. They will benefit from a brisk daily walk or a fun playtime with their owner in the backyard, as they are happiest when someone is with them. Romping inside the home can also provide enough activity. Never over-exercise a Havanese of any age. If they are panting and struggling to keep up, it is time to go home. Havanese do well in both houses and apartments, but they are not happy left alone for hours at a time.","Havanese are highly intelligent and eager to please, and they are easily trained so long as you use only positive methods. This can be a sensitive breed, so care must be taken to not scold them harshly. Socialization from an early age is very important. Expose them calmly to a wide variety of new places and new people, always ensuring that the experiences are positive and not intimidating. Gentle, patient training will result in a wonderful companion dog. They are affectionate with people and get along with other nonaggressive pets."

","Well-bred Hokkaido are generally very healthy, living 12-15 years average... However, like all breeds they are prone to hereditary diseases. Hokkaido are prone to collie eye anomaly, hip dysplasia, luxating patella, heart murmurs, idiopathic seizures, anxiety, psychogenic polydipsia, and pica. When living with a Hokkaido, it is important to monitor them frequently to make sure they are not chewing on items which can cause them harm. Inspect all toys carefully and frequently, and throw away toys that are broken or contain small pieces which can be ingested.","The Hokkaido is a fairly self-managed breed. The natural oils on their skin and coat help to keep them clean and dry despite unfavorable weather conditions. No trimming or shaving of their fur is required or recommended, just regular brushing to remove dead fur and keep the coat healthy. Hokkaido blow their undercoat roughly twice yearly. During this time, a bath and frequent brushing to remove the dead fur is necessary. Their nails should be trimmed regularly to avoid overgrowth and cracking. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","Hokkaido are generally a very active breed. They are best suited for an active family who enjoys spending their time outdoors hiking, biking, jogging, and/or camping. Like all working breeds, it's best to give them a 'job' to do. Hokkaido excel at performance events such as agility, rally, flyball, weight pull, lure coursing, dock diving, and more. Without proper physical and mental stimulation, Hokkaido can become bored, anxious, and hyperactive in your home. If letting your Hokkaido run in your backyard, you should have a six foot fence, as they are good jumpers.

","Hovawarts are quite healthy and live to a ripe old age. One can expect an average lifespan in the 10 to 14 year range and owners should be prepared to dedicate this amount of time to their care. There are no known issues of breed-specific diseases and hip dysplasia rates have been calculated at less than 5%. For a large breed dog, this is an exceptionally low rate.","Because the Hovawart does not have much of an undercoat, it does not need much grooming. Apart from the period of shedding, an occasional brushing will suffice. Beyond this, the occasional bath will keep them clean and looking their best. Their strong fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","Hovawarts are a large breed so the more running room they have, the happier they will be. It is preferable to have a large fenced yard, but substitute exercises such as hiking, trips to a dog park, etc. can make up for some lack in this area. It needs at least a one-hour walk, plus 3 or 4 shorter walks to do 'its business' daily. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise. Apartments are not typically large enough, or have room enough, for the desired activities.","The Hovawart's guarding instincts are best controlled by socialization and exposure to different situations and stimuli. This will allow the dog to understand how each situation should be approached and utilizes the dog's intelligence to assure a measured response. Absent directions, the Hovawart will make his own decision, and it may not match what you want him to do. Training is needed so the dog understands how you want it to make decisions and not rely on its instincts. Appropriate guarding instincts are a learned process, and the dogs need to be educated by exposing them to these situations.



 It is up to the Hovawart owner to be more alert, intentional, directive, and consistent than his dog. The Hovawart needs a leader it can trust. He does not respond positively at all to harsh methods of training; it is much more important to create and sustain the fundamental trust that it wants to feel toward its pack leader."

The Beezer will enjoy vigorous daily play-sessions with his owner or with other dogs, or he can go for long walks a couple of times a day. The Ibizan has a very strong prey drive and should not be allowed off leash in an uncontrolled setting, as he is apt to take off on a chase after perceived prey at a moment's notice. The breed makes a wonderful companion for a regular jogger.","Versatile and trainable, Ibizans make excellent family pets. The breed is even-tempered, affectionate, and loyal.

","Like other large and deep-chested breeds, Wolfhounds can experience bloat, a sudden and life-threatening swelling of the abdomen, and owners should educate themselves about its symptoms and what to do should bloat occur. Responsible breeders will screen their breeding stock for health and genetic conditions such as pneumonia, heart disease, certain cancers and liver shunt. An annual examination, preferably by a veterinarian familiar with sighthounds, is recommended and should include an EKG. Extensive health information is available on the sites of the AKC breed club, the Irish Wolfhound Club of America, and its sister health organization, the Irish Wolfhound Foundation.","Irish Wolfhounds have a double coat that consists of a harsh, wiry outer coat covering a soft undercoat. They shed throughout the year, but not to an excessive degree. A thorough brushing once a week or so will help to remove dirt and loose hair and keep the dog looking his best. Unlike many double-coated breeds, Irish Wolfhounds don't 'blow out' their coats during an annual or semi-annual shedding season. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can be painful to the dog and cause problems walking and running.","Wolfhounds need exercise throughout their lives. Because they retain a strong instinct to hunt and chase prey, they should only be allowed loose in areas that are securely fenced, and any walks must be taken on a leash. As adults, Irish Wolfhounds can become couch potatoes if allowed to, but regular exercise such as long walks or play sessions will help keep them physically and mentally healthy. A home with a fairly large fenced area is necessary to provide the kind of environment in which they can thrive. The breed can also exercise mind and body by participating in canine sports like tracking, agility, and lure coursing.","Wolfhound puppies take 18 months or more to mature, and they can be very destructive, and possibly prone to injuring themselves, when left alone for extended periods. Puppies should have reasonable access to age-appropriate free play, but not with adult dogs, and with no forced exercise. Early socialization and puppy training classes (using positive training methods only) are recommended. Because of their intelligence, Irish Wolfhounds are fast learners. Wolfhounds crave the company of their people, and their sensitivity to humans makes them excellent candidates for therapy work."

Extensive information about breed health can be found on the website of the Italian Greyhound Club of America.","The most important grooming tip for the Italian Greyhound is that the teeth must be brushed on a regular basis, preferably daily. Dental cleaning by a veterinarian should be done yearly or as needed. Baths are rarely necessary unless the dog has gotten into something that can't be removed from the very short, smooth coat by gentle brushing. The nails need regular attention, preferably with a grinding tool. They should not be shortened all the way to the quick. This breed has a hare foot, and the two middle nails can be left slightly longer than the other two.","IGs are an active breed and need regular exercise. For the most part, playtime will be sufficient for this, especially if there is more than one dog. Walks on lead are appreciated. Dog parks can be a hazard unless well supervised and having separate areas for small dogs. Even obedience-trained IGs should not be allowed off lead outdoors in unfenced areas, since small, moving animals are a huge incentive to run, possibly into danger.","This breed responds best to reward-based training methods rather than punishment. The trainer should be firm with commands and lavish with praise. Treats used as a reward should be small but immediate when the command is learned and followed. Professional dog trainers should be chosen carefully. Harsh methods just don't work with these intelligent, sensitive little dogs, even though they can be stubborn."

However, the Japanese Akitainu blows its undercoat twice a year. Profusely. So expect tufts of hair everywhere during that time. A bath, followed by cold forced air dryer and a comb out will help expedite the natural process of blowing coat. Nails should be kept trimmed using clippers or a nail grinder. Regular teeth brushing and maintaining ear cleanliness are essential not just for appearance but for health.  To maintain healthy and luxurious coats, gentle brushing every few days is recommended (depending on activities); for long coats, more frequent brushing will help to avoid matting.","The breed has a high prey drive and may be dog-aggressive; therefore, it is recommended to keep the Japanese Akitainu on leash in public spaces or around other animals and unfamiliar people. Regular walks and mental exercise are highly recommended for the breed. With proper training and precautions, they also make fine companions for outdoor activities such as hiking and camping.","The Japanese Akitainu responds best to positive training and methods that utilize their natural intelligence.

He will require weekly brushing and a bath once a month or so, depending on his surroundings. The breed's nails grow very fast and should be trimmed regularly to keep them short and neat. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris that can cause ear infections, and teeth should be brushed regularly to avoid dental problems.","The Japanese Chin is a fairly active little dog. He will enjoy going for slow walks with his humans, or exploring his fenced backyard. The breed is an excellent choice for apartment living. Because of their stubborn nature, it is never a good idea to allow them to outdoors off lead. If they see something they want to explore, they are likely to refuse to listen to any commands or pleas. They are a bit reserved around new people, pets, and situations, but with proper socialization will enjoy going for romps in a supervised dog park with other small dogs.","Training a Chin can be simple for the trainer who can make them believe they are doing only the things they want to do.

The undercoat, which they shed twice per year, is thick and generous, with an outer coat that is longer. When they ¿blow¿ their coat (aka shedding), the entire undercoat is shed in the span of about 2 to 3 weeks. Daily brushing will be required to remove the fur, but the hair will inevitably be on your clothes, furniture, and floor. For most of the year though, this breed is low maintenance and only requires a weekly brushing with infrequent baths unless the dog gets into something messy. Bathing too often can cause them to lose their natural oils and can irritate their skin, so once per season is sufficient. Luckily, the Japanese Spitz has a teflon-like coat ¿ that is to say, mud and dirt don¿t stick to their fur. If they do get muddy, you simply wait for it to dry and then brush it out. As with all breeds, the Spitz¿s nails should be trimmed regularly.","The Japanese Spitz adapts to many environments. They do well with lots of room to run like on farms and ranches, but also fare well in little spaces like apartments. Either way, they do need regular exercise and enjoy being with their families. A free, interactive run outside or a nice daily walk will benefit them physically and mentally. Afterwards, they will be glad to climb up on the sofa with you while you read or watch TV. An essential thing to remember about Japanese Spitz is that they are companion dogs; they just want you to spend time with them and they will make you laugh and smile in return.","The Japanese Spitz is an intelligent breed and their eagerness to please make them highly trainable.

Systematic health testing has not been the norm until recently, so the true orthopedic and eye status of the breed has yet to be fully explored.","The Jindo is a fastidious breed whose double coat requires weekly brushing with a slicker or pin brush. They are known for being extremely meticulous and clean. Their double coat repels dirt and water, and they do not normally produce an odor. Throughout most of the year, their coat requires little more than weekly brushing to keep shedding at a minimum and the occasional bath for them to look their best. As with all double-coated breeds, twice a year the Jindo 'blows' its coat. During this time, the entire undercoat is shed over the course of a month or more, and both regular brushing of the dog and vacuuming of the home are required.","The Jindo is a high-energy hunting and guard dog with impeccable house manners.

This very athletic breed requires a reasonable amount of physical and mental stimulation. Be it guarding acreage or performing tricks for the neighbors' kids, Jindos love having a job to do and their needs are fairly easily met in an active household. They enjoy sports like lure coursing and agility, have run on sled dog teams, and are happy to turn their athleticism to any active task, even if that task is simply a nice long walk.   Inside the home, Jindos are polite and attentive. They will often follow their owner from room to room, not being clingy but happy to curl up in a corner where they can simply be near and watch over their person or family. If given an active outlet, they seldom bother anything in the home that is not theirs, and they are not a destructive breed.","The Jindo is a very serious hunting dog renowned for his loyalty to his owner and family. He is an extremely intelligent and independent dog with great problem-solving skills and the ability to think for himself. Jindos have a calm, confident, thoughtful nature, never fearful or aggressive without reason. Jindos are one-person dogs, very loyal to their owner and family and often reserved with strangers. The breed is keenly protective of their owner and property and is prized as an intelligent watch dog who does not react unless necessary. It is a breed characteristic for the Jindo to be extremely uncomfortable being forcibly restrained by a stranger. High prey drive is the norm for this extremely athletic hunting breed. The Jindo does not have much tolerance for rude behavior of other dogs and generally is not interested in interacting with strange dogs outside his home. Within the home, same-sex dog aggression is often the norm and opposite-sex pairs are highly recommended. Early socialization and puppy training classes are extremely important in order to expose the Jindo to the many things in his environment and give him the basic skills to become a good canine citizen.

If the coat doesn't get dry or has residual shampoo, it might smell badly.'","Komondors are agile and athletic for their size, and sufficient exercise is important to keep them healthy and happy. Free-running time in a large, securely fenced yard, going for walks, and playing with their housemate dogs all help a Komondor stay in shape. Dog parks are often a bad idea for Komondors. Developed as a livestock guardian breed, their guarding instincts can cause them to react badly to loose stranger dogs, or to the perception that a group of dogs might be a threatening pack.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are important for the Komondor, as are obedience training and a clear understanding that the ""person"" is in charge. They are independent thinkers and can be overly protective if not trained. Because of the dog should have learned to consistently follow commands by the time it is one year of age. Working toward an AKC CD obedience title is a perfect way for the Komondor to achieve this."

","The Kromfohrlander is an extremely rare breed with a very small gene pool. DNA tests are available for hyperkeratosis and Von Willebrand's disease, which means breeders can identify carriers and avoid producing affected dogs; autoimmune problems have been noted in the breed. Keeping an eye on your Kromi's health throughout its life and sharing information will help everyone in the breed better understand the potential health of the breed.","To maintain a tidy appearance, regular hand-stripping or grooming is required. Most Kromis grow a scruffy, wirehaired coat that sheds. It is not to be clipped or shaved. They have little to no doggy odor and dirt just falls off their coats; they are remarkably clean dogs. It is important to continue regular nail clipping as this can become very difficult due to the typical sensitivity of the breed.","Though Kromfohrlanders only wish to be at the side of their special person at all times, regular outside exercise is a requirement. They enjoy fetching a ball or other dog toy. At around age three, they can jump to get a disc, as their joints must be mature. Long walks in a natural setting is the Kromi's favorite kind of exercise. This is NOT a dog-park breed, as they prefer only dogs they already know and do not care for new dogs, new people or new situations.",The Kromfohrlander is very intuitive and a very good guesser. Teaching the Kromi to learn is easy when young but advancing to activities that require more independence such as competitive agility can be a challenge due to the typical sensitivity of the breed. Patience is required.

","The Kuvasz is a healthy breed overall, and responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as elbow and hip dysplasia, autoimmune thyroiditis, patellar luxation, cardiac conditions, and progressive retinal atrophy. No ethical breeder will object to questions regarding health testing results of their breeding stock. Large and deep-chested breeds can develop bloat, a sudden, life-threatening distention of the stomach that can be accompanied by twisting. Owners should learn what signs to look out for and what to do should they occur.","The Kuvasz has a double coat, consisting of guard hair and fine undercoat. His coat is very easy to care for, needing only weekly brushing to remove debris and reduce shedding. Beyond that, an occasional bath will keep him clean and looking his best. His nails should be trimmed every month or so if not worn down naturally, as overly long nails can cause him discomfort.","Having been developed as a strong, active working dog, the Kuvasz requires daily activity for his health and happiness. A fenced yard is essential for this large and agile dog. Adequate and controlled exercise is a necessity for the rapidly growing Kuvasz puppy.","The Kuvasz possesses keen intelligence and determination and is extremely devoted to his family. While these qualities make them wonderful companions, they can also challenge the novice dog owner. Early socialization and puppy training classes are a must for the Kuvasz puppy. Training a Kuvasz takes patience, as this independent breed matures slowly. Sensistive problem-solvers, Kuvasz do not respond well to harsh or repetitive training techniques. The Kuvasz was bred to guard livestock, and he is a natural guardian and will protect family, house, and property."

","Labs are healthy dogs overall, and a responsible breeder screens breeding stock for conditions such as elbow and hip dysplasia, heart disorders, hereditary myopathy (muscle weakness), and eye conditions, including progressive retinal atrophy. A condition called exercise induced collapse (EIC) can occur in some young adult Labs; a DNA test allows breeders to identify carriers and plan breedings to avoid producing the disease. Like other large, deep-chested dogs, Labs can develop a life-threatening stomach condition called bloat. Owners should educate themselves about the symptoms that indicate this is occurring, and what to do if so.","The Lab has a thick, water-repellant double coat that sheds. Give occasional baths to keep them clean. As with all breeds, the Lab's nails should be trimmed regularly and his teeth brushed frequently.","The Labrador Retriever is an exuberant, very energetic breed that needs lots of exercise every day. A Lab who doesn't get enough exercise is likely to engage in hyperactive and/or destructive behavior to release pent-up energy. The breed's favorite activities are retrieving and swimming. Labs also love to burn up energy on hunting trips or at field trials, as well as by participating in canine sports such as agility, obedience, tracking, and dock diving. Many Labs also work hard in important roles such as search-and-rescue, drug and bomb detection, and as service and assistance dogs.","With the Lab's physical strength and high energy level, early socialization and puppy training classes are vital. Gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations between the ages of 7 weeks and 4 months and beginning obedience training early on will help him develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult. Puppy training classes serve as part of the socialization process and help the owner learn to recognize and correct any bad habits that may be developing. Labs are devoted, intelligent, and enthusiastic companions who need to be included in family activities."

They have a double coat of hair rather than fur and shed only minimally, although they may leave little tufts of hair once in a while. The coat needs to be trimmed on a regular basis. Some Lagotto coats mat more than others, and it is important to groom regularly to prevent this. The ears should be checked weekly for buildup of wax or debris, or any signs of infection.","As with most sporting breeds, the Lagotto requires an active, engaged lifestyle to keep him happy. They are not hyper and do not require a great amount of exercise, but they do need both mental stimulation and physical activity. While a Lagotto will enjoy and benefit from time outside, the breed will not do well if left to live outdoors without family interaction.

","There are very few breed health conditions specific to the Lakeland Terrier, and none that have been reported at more than a very low incidence. As with all breeds, a Lakeland's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs.","Lakelands have a beautiful, harsh double coat when maintained properly by hand plucking. Finding someone who can pluck (or ""strip"") a coat is difficult, however. Clippering the coat will also suffice, but with this the color and texture of the coat will fade. Once clipped the coat becomes soft, with loose curls. The hairs tend to not drop out, instead staying caught up in the coat, so the Lakeland is considered a non-shedding breed suitable for people who can't tolerate lots of dander. Brushing weekly will help to remove the loose hairs and prevent mats.","When raised properly, Lakelands are not a hyperactive breed. A good, long walk or brisk jog daily along with frequent opportunities to run in a securely fenced area should keep them fit both physically and mentally. One longtime breeder notes: ""Physically, Lakelands can get enough exercise if they live in a two-story house. Mentally, they need to get a lot of exercise to grow up sane. Walks on short leads don't cut it. All-out running on a 20- or 30-foot line regularly seems necessary.""","The Lakeland needs early socialization, following up with a good basic puppy training class'¿with the class and trainer chosen carefully. A longtime breeder notes: ""Avoid training classes taught by people who do not understand the terrier mind. Lakelands are wicked smart; they learn quickly, and get bored quickly. Make the right thing easy and the wrong thing difficult, and reward good choices."" They learn fast but don't thrive on repetitive training'¿they are simply too smart to perform the same task over and over again."

Aggressive action by breeders and research by animal health organizations has reduced the incidence of PLL. It is important to ensure that parents and their puppies are eye tested.","The Lancashire Heeler is a breed that can go from the field to the show ring. Their short, hard, flat coat is dense and waterproof, needing very little grooming. A light brushing and occasional bath will keep your Heeler happy and clean. The nails should be trimmed, if needed, with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting, and cracking. Ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.","The Lancashire Heeler likes exercise, human interaction, and mental stimulation. They can be demanding of your attention or somewhat laid back, but are always eager to play or just be by your side. Options for exercise include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or being taken for walks several times a day. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or learning new tricks. Certain outdoor activities like swimming, hiking, and retrieving balls or flying discs can provide a good outlet for expending energy. If you live in an apartment, even short walks in the hallways can give your dog some exercise, especially during inclement weather. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience, and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise.","Intelligent and quick to learn, Lancashire Heelers can have a mind of their own, so training should be kind but firm.

","As with all canines, proper exercise and nutrition, routine vet exams, and parasite prevention are keys to a happy and healthy life. Large dogs such as Leos can experience bloat, where the stomach twists and gas is trapped inside. Bloat can quickly be fatal, and it is important to know its signs, such as drooling, restlessness, enlarged abdomen, and attempts to vomit. Owners of at-risk dogs can consider the preventative measure of having their dog's stomach surgically tacked to the abdominal wall.","Leonbergers shed a lot'¿and twice a year, they shed even more. A Leo should be brushed every day, especially in the areas of his body that tend to mat: the long hair behind the ears and on the backs of the legs. A more thorough grooming should be done once a week'¿and given the breed's size, this will take a fair amount of time. Leos have a thick, full outer coat and a shorter, fluffier undercoat. A metal comb and an undercoat rake can be used to work out the undercoat, and a pin brush and a slicker brush will neaten up the outer coat. In addition, a Leo's nailsshould be trimmed every other week.","If you live in a city apartment or a house on a small, suburban lot, this may not be the breed for you. Adult Leonbergers are generally calm and subdued, but they still need to have some vigorous exercise once a day. Puppies and adolescents are active and exuberant. Adult dogs can benefit from jogging or hiking with their owner or keeping pace alongside a bicycle. A large yard with a tall, strong fence is the ideal place for a Leo to run around. Remember, these are working dogs. Drafting'¿that is, pulling a cart'¿and agility training are two good ways for a Leo to get the activity he or she needs.","Leonbergers are very large and strong. In addition, puppies and adolescents have loads of energy and are extremely enthusiastic. With these facts in mind, proper training of the breed is essential. Leo puppies should be socialized by being gently exposed to a wide range of people, animals, and settings before the age of 20 weeks. Group obedience classes will help a Leo learn to be a well-mannered companion and canine citizen. A Leo is probably stronger than and may even outweigh his owner, and it is imperative that he learns to do what you want him to do."

","The Lhasa Apso is generally a robust, healthy dog. The most serious health problem in the breed is hereditary kidney dysfunction, which can be present in mild to severe form. There is no reliable test to detect carriers. Prospective owners should seek out experienced, conscientious breeders who are aware of the condition and remove affected individuals from their breeding programs. Breeders have made great progress toward eliminating this problem, and the risk of acquiring an afflicted puppy from a knowledgeable breeder is slim. Other conditions to inquire about are dry eye, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), slipping stifles, hip dysplasia, and cherry eye.","Long hair or puppy cut? Both require regular maintenance, and this is a choice for the owner to make. Lhasas in a puppy cut or other clip still should be brushed regularly and bathed between visits to the groomer. Long hair requires regular brushing, using the right tools and techniques. Expect to bathe a long coat at least every two weeks, and brush at least once between baths. Thorough rinsing is essential, as shampoo residue irritates the skin. Conditioners and finishing sprays make grooming easier. Freshly bathed long or clipped hair should be thoroughly dried and brushed, as damp hair, even when clean, will mat.","The Lhasa is generally not a couch potato and is adept at self-exercise. They will race around an apartment to run off energy, entertain themselves in a fenced yard, or take their owners on a brisk walk. Mental stimulation is as important as physical exercise. They excel at agility, can do scent work, and have been known to retrieve and herd. There are talented Lhasas certified as therapy dogs working in hospitals, nursing homes, colleges, and prisons.","Lhasa Apsos will please you if it pleases them to please you. They are highly intelligent, sometimes compared to a willful toddler. They can learn just about anything that a trainer makes interesting enough to master'¿on their terms.

It requires daily gentle brushing and combing to the skin to prevent mats and tangles. Maltese should also have regular baths and coat conditioning to keep their hair looking its best. They have fast-growing nails that should be trimmed regularly. Check their ears weekly, and remove any excess hair or wax and any accumulated debris. Because Maltese are prone to dental disease as they get older, their teeth should be brushed frequently'¿ideally each time their coat is brushed. If the dog has excessive tear-staining around the eyes , a visit to the veterinarian to determine a possible cause is recommended.","Maltese are full of energy but require only occasional exercise to keep them healthy and happy.

Most owners keep cloths at hand to wipe 'slingers' off their Mastiff's face and their own and visitors' clothing.","Bred to be guardians of 'hearth and home,' Mastiffs have comparatively low exercise requirements and can live happily in an apartment. They benefit physically and psychologically from free play and daily walks'¿a mile or two for adult Mastiffs. However, owners must be careful not to overtax growing puppies and young adults: Don't allow them to run up and down stairs, jump from heights, or engage in long walks. Begin with no more than half a block for a 2- to 3-month-old puppy. Additionally, Mastiffs are notorious for plopping down during walks when they are tired or overheated. Therefore, a rule of thumb is to not walk them farther than you can carry them back!","Obedience training and early socialization are 'musts' for Mastiffs. Mastiffs learn quickly and want to please. However, the repetitions in a typical training class will quickly bore them, at which point they may lie down, snoring. Make eye contact with your Mastiff; they communicate a great deal with their eyes, and they are excellent at reading your expressions and body language. Use praise and positive rewards'¿you can easily hurt their feelings by raising your voice. Hold several short sessions during the day, keeping it fun and varied. When treated with love, inclusion, and respect, Mastiffs can be trained to excel in almost any sphere."

Teeth should be brushed regularly and should also receive periodic cleanings from your veterinarian.","Exercising an MBT can be tricky. They require enough exercise as puppies to stay in good condition and keep good muscle tone, yet they can be prone to 'sudden lameness.' This is from a combination of weight and density of the muscle, rapid growth rate, and the breed's very character, which keeps them in almost constant motion. Often their joints simply can't handle the excesses until the dog is fully matured. For that reason, exercise of an MBT puppy should be kept at a minimum. Never allow them to jump up and down from heights or make sudden stops at high speeds.","Typical terriers, Mini Bulls require a trainer with a firm hand and a gentle voice, as well as lots of patience and a great sense of humor.

","Neapolitans are generally hardy dogs. One minor problem that often occurs is ""cherry eye,"" where tissue in the corner of the eye becomes red and inflamed. In the vast majority of cases, there is no permanent damage. Despite the breed's impressive wrinkles and loose skin, most do not have skin problems. There are health problems that are common in giant dogs to which the breed is not immune. Bloat is a sudden, life-threatening condition that can affect all deep-chested dogs. Its causes are not fully understood, but owners should learn the signs that bloat is occurring and know what action to take. As with all breeds, the Mastino can also develop hip dysplasia. It is important to discuss any health concerns with the dog's breeder and veterinarian.","The Neapolitan Mastiff is a short-coated breed, so in general a bath now and again is about all you need. The eyes and ears should be checked and gently cleaned whenever necessary with a damp cloth or paper towel. You will find that you will need to keep a towel handy to dry the face and lips (and yourself!), especially after the dog eats or drinks. Nails should be kept short.","Every dog should have the opportunity to run and romp often, but don't emphasize the running and quick turning, as joints can be easily damaged. This is a big, heavily built breed that overheats easily, so be careful in warm weather. The Neo puppy may want to play beyond when he should, so it is up to the owner to stop before the puppy gets too tired. Be careful about letting him go up and down stairs'¿many an exuberant puppy's knee has been injured by a leap off a porch or a jump down those last few stairs. Breed experts do not recommend lots of tug-of-war games or violent wrestling, since the growing Mastino will quickly learn he is stronger than his smaller human friend and think that he no longer needs to listen.","While most adults of the breed are calm animals who sleep a lot, Neapolitan puppies are as active, curious, cute, and cuddly as the most winsome toy puppy. And many people find that the adolescent Neapolitan, when awake, is an energetic, powerful animal. It is important to train the Mastino when he is young, so that when dealing with the strong, stubborn teenage personality stage, the appropriate hierarchy is already in place. By the age of 3 or 4, most Neapolitans demonstrate desirable laidback adult-type behavior. Neapolitans do not respond well to harsh training, and need an encouraging and rewarding atmosphere.

The nails should be trimmed often if not worn down naturally, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort and problems walking and running.","The Norwegian Lundehund has a medium to high energy level and is happiest when he has the opportunity to engage in some form of physical exercise on a daily basis. He will enjoy a brisk, 30-minute walk or a couple of ball-chasing sessions with his owner every day.","The Lundehund is very sensitive and can develop trust issues, and harsh training methods should never be used. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the dog grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion. The breed is incredibly clever, affectionate, and fun-loving, and they are very smart and are problem-solvers of the first order."

","Overall, Norwich Terriers are a healthy breed. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, epilepsy, degenerative myelopathy, and upper airway syndrome, a respiratory condition that is quite variable, and its prevalence and mode of inheritance are poorly understood. Norwich are prone to developing plaque and tartar, so diligent  dental care is essential.","A Norwich Terrier should have a double coat consisting of a harsh, nearly weatherproof outer coat, and a soft undercoat that insulates the body from heat and cold. Hand-stripping removes old outer hairs and excess undercoat so that new hair grows in. Wire coats that are cared for properly by hand-stripping have a beautiful shine and rich colors. Because clipping or scissoring cuts the colored tips off, the natural color will fade, and the texture will soften. The breed requires regular grooming. Learning to hand-strip, or finding a groomer who will hand-strip, is an important consideration in choosing this breed.","The Norwich retains its original hunting instincts and jovial temperament. They are inquisitive and energetic, and they should be in fit condition for the day's activities. They require ample exercise to benefit their mental and physical health. Because of their innate hunting instincts, they must be walked on a leash or let out only in a securely fenced area.","Norwich are spirited little terriers, and they are usually eager to please and respond well to training. Puppies should be properly socialized to develop the amiable, outgoing personality that is characteristic of the breed. They're successful in performance and companion events such as  earthdog , barn hunt,  obedience, and agility."

","Tollers are a relatively healthy breed, with a life expectancy of 12-14 years. Health concerns in the breed include Addison's disease, which often doesn't surface until the dog is middle-aged, the dog may have already produced offspring by the time a diagnosis is made. Efforts to develop a gene-marker test have been unsuccessful so far. Tollers also are somewhat more prone than other breeds to develop autoimmune-related issues.","Tollers require weekly brushing to keep their coat looking its best. During shedding season, daily brushing is often in order. Pay special attention to the coat around and under the ears, as in these areas it is finer and more likely to knot. Because Tollers should be presented as naturally as possible, minimal additional grooming is preferred, and this is generally limited to neatening the areas around the ears and feet. Special care should be taken to remove excess hair from between the pads of the feet, as this will help your Toller maintain traction on indoor surfaces. Attention should also be paid to trimming nails, preferably weekly.","Most Tollers have a medium to high energy level and are not generally content unless they are able to engage in some form of physical exercise on a daily basis. A brisk, 30-minute walk and/or a couple of ball-chasing sessions per day will suffice for many Tollers, though some will need more. Because Tollers love to engage and do things with their owners, many owners participate in canine sports such as agility, flyball, or fieldwork to channel the breed's excess energy. Engaging in these sports has the added benefit of strengthening the bond between owner and Toller.","Temperament-wise, Tollers are often a curious mixture of stubborn and soft. At times they seem to have the brain of a Chessie and the heart of a spaniel. These characteristics can make them challenging to train, as you don't always know whether they are 'putting one on over you.' Most Tollers respond well to reward-based training. They generally want to know what's in it for them and enjoy 'learn to earn' opportunities. They like training to be fun, so short, productive sessions are best. However, it is still important to have consequences for undesirable responses. As one Toller owner put it, 'You don't want them to think they are living on a cruise ship.'"

","Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, eye conditions (PRA and hereditary cataracts), autoimmune thyroiditis, cardiac anomalies, and hereditary deafness. Fortunately, DNA tests now exist for cerebellar ataxia and primary ciliary dyskinesia, two deadly diseases that breeders can avoid producing simply by identifying carriers and not breeding them to other carriers. DNA tests are also available for drug sensitivity and exercise-induced collapse.","The coat is what attracts most people to the Old English Sheepdog. The breed is double-coated and requires a thorough grooming down to the skin, over the entire dog, at least weekly to maintain their full coats. ""Puppy trims"" are good options for pet dogs, but they also require regular brushing between baths and haircuts. Keeping the feet clipped ('Poodle feet') will minimize problems and cleanup. Potential owners need to be prepared to spend the time required to do this, or pay a professional groomer, for several sessions each month for the life of the dog. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly.","This is a breed that requires some physical activity. There is a wide variance in the activity levels, but all require some regular exercise. Fortunately, they do have an ""off switch' when they come indoors.","One longtime breeder advises, ""Never allow your puppy to do something that you would not want a large, shaggy, wet, possibly muddy dog doing in your house."" All OES puppies are adorable, and all grow up to be large, shaggy dogs. Most Old English Sheepdogs are quite intelligent and have a biddable nature. After they learn something, they do not forget it. They do get bored with repetitive, robotic training exercises. If you want to participate in some of those activities, you need to change things up and make it new and fun. As with all dogs, early socialization in puppyhood is vital."

","Otterhounds are healthy for a large breed, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as epilepsy and hip dysplasia, though even dogs with moderate hip dysplasia on radiographs may move very well for their entire lives. Like all large dogs, Otterhounds can experience bloat, a life-threatening condition where the stomach enlarges and sometimes twists. Owners should educate themselves about the signs of bloat and the action to take should it occur.","While Otterhounds should be shown as naturally as possible, their coats do need brushing once or twice a week, depending on length and texture. A good slicker brush and medium comb work for this. The Otterhound's beard may need cleaning at the same time, since the dogs tend to drag them on the ground and store snacks in them. Nails should be trimmed every week or two.","Otterhounds need mental as well as physical exercise. A large, securely fenced yard is a good beginning, but some hounds will lie under a tree in a fenced acre rather than self-exercise. Long walks to sniff the world and visit passersby are good for both owners and hounds. Obedience classes, tracking, and agility all provide mental stimulation as well as good exercise.","As large and strong as Otterhounds are, they can be very sensitive. Use positive, reward-based training methods and praise to get the best results. Like people, Otterhounds love to be told how wonderful and talented they are when they master something. Be patient. Food usually works well in training, but the combination of food and praise together is even better. Clicker training can also work well with Otterhounds."

","Papillons are tough and gutsy, but they are very small. Owners need to be careful with them, especially when they are puppies, around stairs, furniture, and other, larger animals. A small child can accidentally hurt his puppy friend very easily. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as a fontanel in the top of the skull, similar to a human baby's soft spot; and patellar luxation, or kneecaps that can ""slip"" or dislocate, sometimes briefly, sometimes completely.","For a breed with long, silky hair, Papillons needs surprisingly little grooming, mostly because they do not have an undercoat. Grooming every month or so is fine. Between full grooming sessions, you might want to spend a few minutes running a comb or soft slicker brush through the hair inside the hind legs, behind the ears, and on the ""culottes,"" or thigh hair, as mats tend to form there. A Papillon will need a bath every few months, or when he or she gets especially muddy or dirty. The Papillon's nails grow quickly and should be trimmed regularly'¿especially the dewclaw, which can curl around and pierce the leg. Finally, regular tooth brushing is vital for dental health.","Thanks to their small size, Papillons make wonderful indoor pets, but that doesn't mean they don't need exercise. They are active, smart dogs, and they will want their people to play with them. Indoors, they enjoy retrieving a small ball or toy'¿a Papillon will quickly learn to bring it back so you can throw it again. Outdoors, true to their spaniel heritage, Papillons will happily run in the yard to chase after squirrels, chipmunks, and even insects. Papillons tend not to realize how small they actually are, so owners need to watch carefully if they set out after a larger dog, or even a cat.","Papillons are intelligent and eager to please the humans they have bonded with. Generally speaking, some small breeds can take a little longer to housetrain than large breeds do, but Papillons make the process easier. Early socializationis very important, and obedience classes are a good idea'¿your Papillon will learn to do what you tell him to, and you will learn not to overindulge your adorable companion. And remember that the Papillon is a companion dog at heart; they may be unhappy and develop undesirable behaviors if left left alone for long periods of time. Fortunately, a Papillon can bond with other pets as well as humans."

Both require regular brushing'¿the smooth with a thick brush or hound glove, and the rough with a pin or slicker brush. Rough coats will require plucking or clipping to avoid matting of the longer hairs. A monthly bath should be sufficient, unless the Parson follows his nature and ends up digging in the mud. The Parson's nails should be trimmed monthly and his ears checked weekly for debris or excess wax, and cleaned as needed.","Parson Russell Terriers are playful, affectionate, fun-loving companions. They have a great zest for life and are always ready to join in activities. They are also high-energy terriers with powerful hunting instincts'¿with their strong prey drive, keeping them on leash during outings is recommended, rather than letting them run loose, where the urge to go off on a chase may be irresistible. An ideal day for a pet Parson would include a long walk in the woods, where he could explore every hole and sniff every tree trunk. Exercise can also consist of play sessions in the backyard. A Parson is the dog for someone who is fairly active. He will not be satisfied to lie alone in the corner for long periods of time.","Training the Parson Russell Terrier requires consistency, a gentle voice, and a great sense of humor. Smart, energetic, happy-go-lucky little dogs, they get bored easily, so training sessions must be kept fun and interesting.

","As with all short-faced breeds, it is important to choose a Pekingese with wide-open nostrils on a moderate-sized nose. Because Pekingese don't have a long muzzle to act as a natural barrier of protection for the eyes, it is important to ensure that your environment is safe for your Peke and that nothing can jab or irritate his eyes. Pekingese appreciate cold temperatures, and therefore some owners travel with their Pekes on frozen ice packs, or an ice pillow, even for rides in the car, which provides a level of comfort that Pekingese thoroughly enjoy. Working with a responsible breeder, those wishing to own a Peke can gain the education they need to know about specific health concerns within the breed. Good breeders utilize health testing of their breeding stock to reduce the likelihood of disease in their puppies.","The thick double coat of the Pekingese requires a good bit of maintenance. Pekingese shed seasonally. Brushing him at least one hour per week will help to remove loose hairs and prevent matting, and an occasional bath will help to keep him looking his best. Mats or tangles can be gently worked out with a slicker brush or metal comb. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort.","Pekingese are charming, confident companions who develop a close bond with their people. Their whole purpose in life is to amuse and comfort. Although they are fairly sedate most of the time and have only modest exercise requirements, they do enjoy participating in canine sports at their own pace.","A hallmark of the breed is their friendly, outgoing, loving personality. Pekes are affectionate and intelligent and develop very strong connections to their people. As dogs who for centuries lived in palaces, Pekes can be as serenely independent as the emperors who owned them. (They're 'opinionated,' Peke people often say.)

","Dr. Stephen Sipperly, chair of the Pharaoh Hound Club of America health committee, notes that the requirements for a CHIC certification for a Pharaoh Hound include screening for hip and elbow dysplasia, patella luxation and eye disorders, and he adds that the majority of results for all those screenings are normal. The most common cancers in the breed are hemangiosarcoma, and mast cell tumor and mammary cancer, though some of these conditions are likely age related and afflict all dogs, regardless of breed or mix. 'Looking at the results, I can say with confidence that the Pharaoh Hound is not plagued with any significant disorders,' Dr. Sipperly says.","Pharaoh Hounds do not require a great deal of grooming.

Be sure to request to see copies of OFA results of the litter's parents from the breeder when considering a puppy.","The Pomeranian's profuse double coat is one of his most distinguishing features. Frequent brushing is necessary to maintain the beautiful coat that we admire. Brush through the dog with a pin brush and a slicker brush down to the skin once a week to keep the hair from matting.

It is highly recommended that you find a groomer to do a full groom'¿including bath, brushing, ears, nails, and anal glands'¿every four to six weeks, if you are not comfortable with doing this at home. You should also pay close attention to the Pom's teeth. It is a good idea to brush the teeth during their weekly grooming session.","As much as Pomeranians enjoy being lapdogs and family companions, they do benefit from some exercise and enjoy the chance to run, play, and go for walks. Be sure to keep a close eye on your Pom when he or she is outside. They are notorious for escaping through small crevices or gaps in fencing, or climbing over short fencing. Small breeds like Pomeranians can be mistaken for rabbits or squirrels by large, predatory birds such as hawks and owls, so it is vital to keep a Pom under cover or stay with them at all times. When taking your Pom for a walk, be cautious of your surroundings. Other dogs who are not controlled can easily hurt your Pom.","The Pom should be trained to walk on a leash early on and taught to come when called. Housebreaking can be a challenge, so consistency and patience are key. It is important to keep your Pom from jumping on and off couches or beds, as they can injure joints or even break a bone.

","The Pug's dark, appealing eyes are one of his main attractions, but also one of his vulnerable spots. Eye problems including corneal ulcers and dry eye have been known to occur. Like all flat-faced breeds, Pugs sometimes experience breathing problems and do poorly in sunny, hot, or humid weather. The website of the breed's parent club, the Pug Dog Club of America, offers detailed information on breed health.","The Pug's short, smooth, glossy coat needs minimal maintenance, but it does shed. Weekly brushing with a medium-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt, or a hound glove will help to remove the loose hair and help keep him looking his best. Pugs don't need to be bathed unless they happen to get into something particularly messy or start to get a doggy odor. The Pug's nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause him discomfort.","Given the opportunity, a Pug will happily spend much of the day snuggling on the sofa'¿which, combined with the breed's fondness for eating, makes obesity a real possibility. But the Pug is playful, sturdy, and lively, too, and owners can keep the breed fit with daily opportunities for moderate exercise, such as walks or play sessions in the yard. It's vital to remember that as a short-faced breed Pugs aren't tolerant of hot weather, and they shouldn't do strenuous exercise when it's warm or humid out'¿better to be in air-conditioning. Some canine sports in which Pugs participate and excel include agility, obedience, and rally.","The Pug has been bred to be a companion and a pleasure to his owners. He has an even and stable temperament, great charm, and an outgoing, loving disposition. Pugs live to please their people, so they are generally easy to train. Their feelings are easily hurt, and harsh training methods should never be used. A Pug wants to be with his family and will be unhappy if he is regularly left alone for long periods of time. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended."

","Reputable breeders test their breeding stock for health problems that can occur in most any breed. Breeders who are members of the Puli Club of America agree to the club's guidelines, which include Canine Health Information Center (CHIC) testing to determine that breeding stock is free of inheritable disease. The CHIC testing required by the breed's parent club includes OFA or PennHIP screening for hip dysplasia, OFA test for patella, OFA test for degenerative myelopathy (DNA test), and CERF eye testing (to be updated every three years). Additional tests that can be performed, but are not required, include OFA for elbows, cardiac, and thyroid, and the BAER (hearing) test. If you are considering getting a Puli, ask the breeder if they test for these conditions, in particular the club's required tests.","The Puli can be kept corded, brushed, or with a clipped coat. Until a Puli puppy is 8 to 10 months old, there is no grooming to do except for regular bathing  and ears, and grinding toe nails. When the Puli's undercoat begins to come in, the coat will begin to feel thick and matted to your fingers. You will begin to feel natural separations in the coat, where the hair seems to clump together close to the skin. This is the beginning of a cord. At this time, you can separate these soft clumps from each other by pulling them apart with your fingers. Cords are simply 'organized mats' that have tightened up with time. This is a process that will be repeated many times over the course of about six to nine months. Once the coat has distinct cords, all you do is bathe the dog when needed and separate the cords'¿a good time to do this is while you are watching TV and need something to do with your hands. The breed's national parent club, the  Puli Club of America, provides a number of articles on grooming on the club's website.","The Puli is a high-drive dog who requires both physical and mental stimulation. In fact, mental exercise is as important as physical exercise for this breed. Reputable breeders caution people to not overdo the physical exercise when the dog is young and the growth plates have not yet fused or closed. The Puli excels at canine sports including herding, obedience, and agility, among other activities.","This is a breed that needs to be kept mentally active. Pulik are incredibly intelligent, agile, and loyal, which makes them able to learn quickly, and they strive to please their owners. However, they do not suffer fools lightly (there is a running joke that you need to be very smart to own a Puli), and they require a firm but fair hand. This is a headstrong breed who has no problem humiliating you in public'¿so prepare yourself. Pulik are herding dogs, and as such, many of them do not give up control easily. They will follow commands, but they do things their own way. They do not care for repetition. With puppies especially, it is important to do proper socialization."

The website of the breed's parent club, the Hungarian Pumi Club of America, provides detailed information on Pumi health.","The Pumi's coat consists of 50 percent soft hair and 50 percent harsher hair, all the same length. He needs combing every three to six weeks, followed by a good wetting-down to let the coat curl back up. Once curled, the coat can be trimmed to keep it looking tidy. The Pumi doesn't shed, but hair will come out during grooming. Using a blow-dryer on the Pumi's coat is not recommended, as this will remove the characteristic curls.","The Pumi is very intelligent and energetic, needing regular exercise and mental stimulation. They're also quite agile and will climb over and under things, and they love to be in high places to see what's going on. Their favorite toys are often tennis balls and flying discs, and a Pumi is likely to demand a good chase-and-fetch game with these. The breed's qualities make the Pumi increasingly popular in agility, obedience, and numerous other dog sports and companion events.","The Pumi is a thinking dog who must assess each new situation, so it is vital for the breed to have early socialization as puppies. A Pumi will learn quickly and has a boundless willingness to work without being obsessive about it. He is an active dog, and if provided with daily exercise and mental activity he makes a wonderful housedog. Because Pumik enjoy using their voices, barking should not be reinforced."

The Pyrenean Mastiff is a double-coated breed, so it does shed twice a year. Beyond those times, it does not typically shed much hair. Use a rake to aid in removing loose hairs when shedding.","Allowing free play all the time except right after eating is fine, but walking your Pyrenean Mastiff puppy can be harmful if the distance is not increased slowly.

Periodontal disease, the build-up of tooth tartar, can begin by one year of age. Regular dental care such as teeth brushing can reduce plaque and prevent surgical dental cleaning or teeth removal. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and patellar luxation, and owners should be aware of the risk for eye injuries, such as ulcers.","The longhaired variety requires more grooming than the smooth-coated variety for obvious reasons. The long coat has body hair from 1-3 inches long. Their ears are covered with thick, long hair forming a fringe, and there are distinct feathers on the rear side of his limbs. The longhaired variety should be brushed two to three times per week and fringes should be kept free of debris. Monthly baths with high-quality shampoo and conditioner are usually enough to keep the coat healthy.



 The smooth-coated Russian Toy has short, close-lying, shiny hair without an undercoat or fringes. Regular weekly brushing with a soft brush along with occasional baths is recommended to keep the smooth coat free of dead hair and flaky skin. A daily shammy wipe-down adds luster to the coat, too.","The Russian Toy is considered to have a moderately high energy. They need regular exercise, but because of their small size, a regular yard or long run is usually sufficient. They love going for walks with their humans and love to run and play until they collapse in your lap for a long snuggle.



 Because small dogs have more fragile necks and tracheas than large dogs, it is recommended that a leash be attached to a harness instead of a collar when walking your Russian Toy. It is also recommended that you do not leave a collar or harness on your Russian while in your home. Many times a collar or harness can get caught on things around the house and injure your little imp.","Generally, Russian Toys are agreeable and eager to please, making them very trainable. However, they are still terriers at heart, can be stubborn, and will try to be the boss. Their clown-like antics and outgoing friendly personality make them great candidates for agility and trick-dog competition.



 The RTCA, the breed's AKC parent club, highly recommends early socialization of your puppy. Many all-breed kennel clubs, community centers, and veterinarians offer puppy kindergarten classes as well as many levels of obedience training."

","Routine health checks should include eye, patella, and heart examinations. To avoid patella injuries, young dogs should not be encouraged to jump until they are adults. Keeping topknots tied up will help to prevent corneal abrasions to the eyes. Although not found frequently in Bolonki, responsible breeders also screen their stock for health conditions such as liver shunt, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease and PRA.","The Russian Tsvetnaya Bolonka requires regular brushing and routine care for eyes, ears, teeth, and nails. Brush or comb the coat with a wide-tooth comb on a regular basis several times per week to prevent mats from forming. Dogs kept in full coat may need their face, mustache, and beard washed daily. For show purposes, no other trimming other than the feet is permitted, and the coat on the back should fall naturally and should not be deliberately parted. The eyes and ears should be checked frequently for foreign matter, injury, and irritation. Keeping the eyes clean will help avoid infections. Hair in the eyes can cause irritation, leading up to painful corneal scratches and ulcers. Drop ears are prone to infection, particularly after bathing or swimming, so be sure to keep ears clean and dry.","As classic lapdogs, Bolonki enjoy walks and playtime, but do not require a great deal exercise. They can be very energetic and play driven, however, and should have a good romp at least twice per week. In addition to walks, exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or learning new tricks.","More independent than is usual for a toy breed, Bolonki require early socialization with people. However, they are very friendly with children and other animals, though supervision is always a good idea. In addition, Bolonki may like to alert you to everything that is happening around them, so training them to understand when vocalizations are appropriate may be necessary. This breed is very clever and smart and does well in obedience, rally, tracking, and agility when trained with a firm, but gentle, hand."

","Large and deep-chested breeds can develop bloat, a sudden, life-threatening stomach condition. Saint Bernard owners should learn what signs to look out for, and what actions to take should they occur. Other conditions sometimes seen in the breed include hip dysplasia and eye disease. A Saint can handle hot weather as long as he has a cool place to rest and lots of water, but going from air conditioning to high heat can cause serious distress.","Saint Bernards come in long-haired and short-haired varieties, but both types of coats require the same care. Weekly brushing will help to remove dirt and loose hair and keep the dog looking his best. Any tangles can be worked out with a slicker brush or metal comb. During shedding season, which occurs twice a year, brushing will become a daily activity. The occasional bath will keep the Saint looking and smelling fresh. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can be painful to the dog and cause problems walking and running.","Despite being a large and powerful breed, the St. Bernard only requires a moderate amount of exercise. One long walk or half-hour play session per day should be enough to keep him healthy and happy. Of course, if his owner wants to take longer hikes, or go backpacking or on a camping trip, a Saint is always happy to go along. Saints often enjoy pulling young children in a cart, and some even participate in carting and drafting competitions. A Saint is happiest when he is doing activities together with his owner.","Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended for all dogs, but are absolutely required for dogs as big and strong as a St. Bernard. Obedience training will help the Saint learn not to jump on people, knock into small children, steal food from the table, and otherwise take advantage of their size. Saints are kind-hearted and eager to please, so they generally start responding to commands as soon they understand what is expected of them. A Saint wants to be with his family, and undesirable behaviors can result if he is regularly left alone for long periods of time."

","As a breed, Salukis are free from serious genetic diseases. Some may develop heart conditions such as valve disease or arrhythmia, and enlarged hearts are not unknown. Certain cancers such as hemangiosarcoma or osteosarcoma, lymphoma, or mammary cancers (the latter is prevented by early spaying) can occur, and some autoimmune and blood conditions have been reported. Vigorous running and playing after eating can cause bloat, or gastric torsion (which is a life-threatening emergency and needs immediate intervention). Generally, however, Salukis enjoy a healthy, active life from birth to old age.","Salukis have two types of coats'¿feathered and smooth'¿and both are easily groomed with weekly brushing, although if they have long ear or tail feathering, that may take a bit more attention. Many Saluki owners use a snood to keep ear feathering out of the food bowl (smooth Salukis do not have that problem). Salukis are very clean dogs and known for not having a 'doggy' odor. Bathing need only be done if they get dirty or before a dog show.","Salukis need regular exercise to keep fit, and daily walks (always on a leash) will help both hound and owner stay in shape, physically and mentally. Salukis love to run and should have a well-fenced yard to keep them safely away from traffic. Like other dogs, Salukis can be escape artists or destructive chewers when bored or unhappy at home, so good fencing and safe toys and chew-bones are a must.","The Saluki will benefit from three types of training: (1) Crate training is recommended for those times when the dog needs to be safely confined in the home or while traveling. (2) Basic obedience training will help the dog learn manners in the home and community. Well-behaved dogs are welcome almost everywhere. (3) For mental stimulation and exercise, canine sports such as lure coursing, flyball, and agility are all fun options. Lastly, if you start when they are young, it is possible to train Salukis to hold still for nail trimming and daily teeth brushing."

","Although a giant breed, a significant percentage of Scottish Deerhounds live to old age. While the breed does have some genetic health issues, the good news is many of the problems can be avoided, prevented, or treated successfully if the owner is proactive. Puppy buyers should buy a puppy from a responsible breeder who does the breed¿s recommended health tests and will be a resource for the dog¿s entire life. Another key to Deerhound health (in addition to good genes) is for the dog to be happy and well exercised. Deerhounds need a lot of exercise daily throughout their lives. For dogs under 18 months, the exercise needs to be age-appropriate; owners should consult with their dog¿s breeder and veterinarian for exercise recommendations for youngsters.  Also, they are devoted family dogs that are happiest when their owners include them into their lives as much as possible. Finally, owners can educate themselves about the breed's problems such as osteosarcoma, dilated cardiomyopathy, cystinuria, surgery-related issues (Factor VII deficiency, slow drug metabolism, delayed bleeding, and hyperthermia), liver shunt, and GDV/gastric or splenic torsion/bloat so problems can be avoided or identified and treated as early as possible, which greatly improves outcomes, in many cases. Detailed information on the breed¿s health and research can be found on the Scottish Deerhound Club of America¿s Deerhound Health website at https://deerhoundhealth.org/.","The Scottish Deerhound's harsh, somewhat wiry coat is very easy to care for, requiring only an all-over brushing and combing every week or so. He will also need a trim of his nails every few weeks if they aren't worn down naturally. Grooming tools to have on hand include a slicker brush, a fine-toothed metal dog comb, and an electric nail grinder or a pair of heavy-duty dog nail clippers. A occasional bath will help to reduce any doggy odor. Grooming sessions are a good time to inspect the dog all over for any new lumps or skin problems, and to check that the eyes and ears are healthy and trouble free.","Deerhound puppies are difficult to raise to their potential without a companion playmate and a large, securely fenced play area. This breed cannot be left crated in the house while the owner is at work all day if it is to develop properly to adulthood, both physically and mentally. Both puppies and adults need to be able to exercise freely on a daily basis and do what Deerhounds were bred to do'¿run for the sheer joy of running. Destructive puppies are generally not getting enough exercise. Forced exercise, such as running with a bike, should be avoided with immature hounds. Older Deerhounds are hard to pry off your couch, but they do require regular daily exercise regardless. While nutrition and exercise are key to raising a puppy into a fit, well-muscled adult, the secret to a healthy, long-lived Deerhound (in addition to good genes) is being happy and well exercised. This is not a breed that handles stress well, nor is it a breed that will thrive with just a daily leash-walk around the city block. Fitness should be maintained throughout old age.","The most beautiful Deerhound puppy in the world will turn into a wonderful adult only if given lots of gentle human companionship, exercise, and proper nutrition. Deerhounds are sensitive and respond best to positive training methods. They won't do well in a kennel or left in a crate while their people go to work. While he possesses a quiet and dignified personality in the home, the Scottish Deerhound may try to chase any furry animals that run past him. For that reason, the breed should be exercised on leash or in a fenced area. Although he enjoys his family, his size may be intimidating to smaller children."

","The breed's national parent club, the Scottish Terrier Club of America, provides excellent information regarding breed health issues on the club website. A good breeder will discuss with you what they have encountered in their lines. There is also some excellent research being done, much of which is supported by the club, to help breeders identify health conditions and make better decisions when choosing to breed. That means overall better health for the future generations.","Scottish Terriers require regularly scheduled grooming. They are a dual-coated breed, with a harsh, wiry outer layer and dense, soft undercoat. Ideally, they are hand stripped. This should be started when they are young puppies so they get used to the process. Once a month would be best once the coat is started, but they can be worked on weekly. If you are not doing it yourself, it may be hard to find a groomer who will do this for a pet. In that case it is acceptable to clipper the coat. With clipping you will eventually lose the correct harsh texture, as the undercoat will take over once the cutting process is begun. Clipped coats can be maintained on a six- to eight-week schedule. A weekly brushing and comb-out will keep the Scottie's coat tangle free and the skin healthy. Periodic baths with the grooming is acceptable with a good-quality moisturizing shampoo.","Scottish Terriers need a good walk, but also good playtime. They have high energy and need to expend some of that in bursts. Throwing a ball or toy around that they can chase works great. Their nickname is the 'diehard,' and all you have to do is play tug with a favorite toy to see they won't stop or let go until you do. All of that activity will keep them in good shape and attitude. This makes them great dogs for a small home or apartment living.","Scottish Terriers do best with training sessions not lasting more than 15 minutes at a time. Be creative, and do not repeat the training the same way all the time. This breed is a thinker, and if they get bored, they will not respond. Remember, the farmers kept the dogs who could figure things out'¿not the ones who had to be told what to do. Don't be surprised when they test you. There is an independent streak in them. That is best focused when you make it seem like it is their idea to do something. They respond greatly to vocal tones and know why you are displeased by your voice. Just be persistent, and reward good behavior."

","Allergies are fairly common in the breed but are seldom of a really serious nature. There are several genetic eye diseases that potential sires and dams should be tested for before breeding. The American Sealyham Terrier Club provides detailed information on breed health. Non-genetic eye conditions such as tearing and infections can occur because of the breed's long eyebrows. If the dog is a pet, a shorter eyebrow fall is a good idea. Ear infections can occur due to the weight and position of the ears, but keeping the ears clean is usually all that is required for prevention and maintenance.","The breed's weather-resistant, double 'jacket' and profuse leg and body furnishings must be combed and brushed every two or three days, as Sealy coats tend to mat easily. The coat does not shed but must be hand-stripped or clipped on a regular basis. Pet Sealyhams can be kept trimmed short with minimal furnishings, which makes their care easier. Bathing every three to four weeks is a good idea. For Sealyhams in show coat, washing at least the furnishings frequently is a must. The nails should be trimmed regularly, and the eyes and ears  should be checked during grooming sessions.","Sealys love to run in a safely enclosed area and enjoy plenty of exercise. They can overheat in hot, humid weather, so exercise is best in the early morning and in the evening. Grass stains are common, and it may be necessary to wash furnishings and condition often. Encourage Sealys to exercise so they get moderately tired, but not exhausted, and they will be calmer in the house. Sealys can be very active, and exercise helps them be better house pets.","As with most terriers, Sealys require a firm but not harsh training technique. The Sealy puppy should be socialized early, being gently exposed to a wide range of dogs, people, and places, and this will help to discourage any dog aggression later on. Sealys can be food guarders, and this must be corrected right away. Don't allow the dog to get away with it, ever."

Tests are available for many potentially heritable disorders, and minimum health testing of breeding stock is recommended by the breed's national parent club, the American Shetland Sheepdog Association (ASSA).","The Sheltie has a profuse double coat that sheds considerably. The outer coat consists of long, straight, harsh hair, while the undercoat is short, furry, and very dense.

Be sure to check for mats behind the ears, under the elbow on each front leg, and in the ""pants"" under the tail. Shaving the dog is not recommended, because the coat protects against sunburn and heat as well as cold. The Sheltie needs a bath only occasionally. The nails should be trimmed regularly.","Shelties are active and athletic, and while they need a moderate amount of exercise they are also very adaptable to their family's way of life. They do well as city dogs as long as owners provide sufficient exercise. They enjoy outings with their people that will exercise both their mind and body. Shelties enjoy and excel in many canine events, including obedience, agility, herding, and tracking, and they shine as therapy dogs.","As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Very intelligent, trainable, and willing to please, the Sheltie will reach his full potential as a companion when taught at least basic obedience'¿and they are superstars at canine sports such as agility. Shelties can be quite vocal and express their happiness with barking, so owners must be prepared to teach the dog to stop barking when desired.

","The most common health condition in Shibas and in most breeds, as well as humans, is allergies. In dogs, allergies manifest themselves as skin irritation and itching. There is no way of testing breeding stock, but dogs with active allergies should not be bred. Unless the source of the allergen can be identified, most dogs with allergies can lead normal lives with products that treat the symptoms'¿again, just like humans. Allergies usually don't manifest themselves until a dog is at least 6 months old.

Blowing the dog with a strong blow-dryer or a shop vacuum in reverse is a good way to remove loose hair, dirt, and dandruff and to check for fleas. Most dogs learn to like the blower, as it feels good and doesn't scrape the skin or pull the coat. Don't let it get too hot, though. Shibas often object to nail trimming. Start a puppy early, but if it becomes a major struggle, let a professional do it.","Most Shibas are fairly energetic and love to go for walks. They are not so hyper that they will climb the walls if they don't get daily exercise, but a Shiba owner should be dedicated to exercising the dog, especially if the dog doesn't have an adequate yard in which to exercise himself. In general, Shibas are not massively destructive if left alone once they reach maturity, but some can suffer separation anxiety and should be able to spend periods of time crated even when the owners are home and at night. Crating guarantees a home will remain intact.","The one thing every Shiba owner must know is that a Shiba can never, ever be considered reliable off lead unless in a confined area. No amount of obedience training will ever change that. Letting a Shiba off lead'¿or any dog, for that matter'¿is playing Russian roulette with its life. An open door, an unlocked gate, a moment of inattentiveness, and the Shiba may be gone forever. On the positive side, a Shiba is practically born housebroken. By 4 weeks of age the puppy is trying to get as far away from his sleeping area as possible to eliminate. By 5 weeks the puppy will hold it all night and wait until taken outside to go. Controlling the bladder takes a little longer and depends a lot on immediate access to outdoors and diligence of the owner."

","Because of their heavy coats and short faces, Shih Tzu do not tolerate heat well and are not good swimmers. Most Shih Tzu are generally healthy, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as such as hip dysplasia, patellar luxation (a slipped kneecap), eye anomalies including cataracts, progressive retinal atrophy, retinal detachment, and corneal dryness and inflammation from excessive exposure to the air because of improperly closing eyelids.","A Shih Tzu with a long coat requires daily brushing. Use a good-quality wire brush with flexible pins, and layer the hair to be sure you reach to the skin. A bath about every three or four weeks will help to keep the coat clean and at its best. Remember to comb the mustache and topknot daily, and gently clean the corner of the  eyes with a damp cloth. To protect the Shih Tzu's eyes from being irritated, the hair on the top of the head should be trimmed short or tied up into a topknot. If you don't want to have to spend time on your dog's coat, the Shih Tzu can look adorable when clipped into a ""puppy trim"" by a professional groomer. Trimming nails and cleaning ears should be part of the Shih Tzu's grooming routine.","The Shih Tzu was bred to be a house companion. As such, they require minimal exercise. Short daily walks with their owner and indoor playtime will satisfy the activity needs of this small, short-legged companion.","Training a Shih Tzu can be both an amusing and a frustrating experience. The breed tends to charm his owner into letting him have his own way, which can result in a chubby, less-than-completely-housebroken pet who is difficult to groom. Because Shih Tzu are such people dogs, training methods based on praise and rewards work best. Harsh corrections should not be used with this breed. Introduce desired new behaviors a bit at a time, be firm, and never give in while the dog is misbehaving. If he nips or jumps up on you, ignore him until he settles down, then praise him. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the Shih Tzu grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion. When enrolling in a puppy class, be sure that the training methods used in the class are based on positive reinforcement."

","Fortunately, the Siberian Husky is a relatively healthy breed. Responsible breeders screen their breeding stock for health problems such as juvenile cataracts, and the breed's national parent club, the Siberian Husky Club of America, has strict guidelines to help reduce reported cases. Beginning at 12 months of age, all Siberians who potentially will be part of a breeding program should be examined by a canine ophthalmologist. The exam is then repeated on a yearly basis. New screenings and tests are being constantly being developed to help breeders in their selection of a potential dam and sire. Knowledgeable breeding practices ensure the future health of the breed. Owners of working Siberians need to closely monitor each dog to be able to recognize when something just isn't right. Having a veterinarian familiar with working dogs is an advantage.","Siberian Huskies are considered a 'natural' breed. They are remarkably self-cleaning and often need only a few baths a year, unless being shown in conformation dog shows. Weekly brushings help keep the coat and skin in good condition. Siberians have a double coat'¿an undercoat, and guard hair. The undercoat is shed twice a year, and it is important to continually 'rake out' the old coat, using a pin brush and metal comb. Pay close attention to the length of the nails, and keep them trimmed to prevent any foot problems. Siberians competing in conformation require a bit more selective grooming for the best presentation.","Siberians are active, athletic dogs who need a lot of exercise. They are a working breed and happiest when they have a function to perform. Regular exercise is important both physically and mentally, and doing activities together strengthens the bond between dog and owner. Siberians were bred to run and will do so at every opportunity; it is vital to keep the dog on a leash, in harness, or in a fenced yard at all times. There are several AKC-sponsored activities that can be enjoyed by dog and owners'¿rally, agility, and obedience are a few. A busy and active Siberian is a happy and healthy Siberian. This breed is also very adaptable, and for those who live in a more urban setting, daily walks or doggie play groups can provide great exercise.","All breeds benefit from early socialization, basic obedience training, and learning good manners, and the Siberian Husky is no exception. For those owners who want to work their dogs in harness, training for this requires hours of dedication and patience. There are several good books available on training for the trail that provide advice and information on getting started. The best approach is to make all training exercises fun for both dog and handler. Siberians are very social, and regularly need the company of their people or other dogs; they are not suited to being left alone all day. Most importantly, Siberians have an overwhelming desire to run, and they should be on leash or in a securely fenced-in area at all times and never allowed off lead."

","While Silky Terriers are generally healthy dogs, there are several health and genetic screening considerations specific to the breed. Responsible breeders test their stock for conditions the breed can be prone to, including patellar luxation and eye disease. A Silky Terrier's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs. Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure the dog a long, healthy life.","The Silky Terrier's coat should be brushed at least twice a week with a pin brush or soft bristle brush. A long-toothed metal dog comb can also come in handy for gently working through areas where tangles may be beginning to form. Left unattended, tangles and mats are uncomfortable for your dog and can cause skin problems to develop. The nails should be trimmed once a month, and a bath every four to six weeks with a gentle shampoo meant for dogs will help to keep the coat and skin clean and healthy. Grooming sessions are a good time to check the dog all over for any new lumps or skin problems, and to check that the eyes and ears are healthy and trouble free.","More a terrier than a lapdog, the Silky Terrier requires more exercise than most Toy Group breeds. Intelligent, bold, and energetic, Silkies need human partners who will know how to channel that energy into daily exercise and training for sports and work. The breed does well in the conformation ring, and Silkies have been successful in companion events, particularly agility.","Silky Terriers can adapt well to any living situation but need owners who have the time to devote to them'¿they do not like to be ignored, preferring to play fetch or go on walks with their family. Taken by the breed's charm, owners may be tempted to let a Silky Terrier get away with undesirable behaviors; it's best to be sure to make rules and stick to them.

Other conditions that responsible breeders screen for include autoimmune disease, skin allergies, hip dysplasia, and luxating patellas.","The Skye's long, luxurious double coat appears more challenging to maintain than it actually is.

Ears should be checked at least weekly and cleaned of any excess wax or debris to avoid ear infections. Baths can be given as needed'¿usually once a month will be enough. Do not scrub the coat during shampooing, as that can cause it to mat.","The Skye Terrier has minimal exercise needs and will usually be content with whatever level of activity is comfortable for his owner.

Skyes enjoy play sessions and participating in canine sports with their people, and the breed can be found competing in dog shows and agility, obedience, and earthdog events.","The Skye is a very intelligent but strong-willed breed, calmer than many of the terrier breeds. They are amenable to training, provided it is consistent and done in a positive manner. They are sensitive to correction and will withdraw from harsh or negative training methods. Like all terriers, they can be stubborn, but they enjoy interaction with their humans and are eager to please.

 The breed's hunting heritage means they have a high activity level and need appropriate outlets for their energy, including daily exercise. If you don't hunt with your Small Munsterlander, be sure to give him other ways to tire himself out, such as going for a run or playing in a fenced area. They need to be supervised outdoors since their instinct is to hunt. If proper stimulation and exercise are not provided, they will wander and self-hunt when left to their own devices.","Like other versatile dogs, this breed is relatively slow to mature. It¿s not until they reach two years of age that most Small Munsterlanders are mentally adult.

SWDs are usually strong swimmers, and playing fetch in the water is a great way to burn off energy without the risk of injury that repetitive impact through retrieving on land can cause.","This is a highly intelligent and active (both mentally and physically) breed. They thrive on the problem-solving nature of positive training using a clicker or similar training style. SWDs are extremely biddable and willing to please and are showing themselves to be highly capable and very versatile. Harsh training methods may cause the SWD to lose his enthusiasm for the tasks asked of him, and he may ""shut down."" Potential owners are reminded that as herding dogs, some SWDs have a very high prey drive. They need a reliable recall. Even with diligent training, some will not be able to resist the temptation of a squirrel, rabbit, or deer. The temperament of the Spanish Water Dog deserves special consideration. These dogs are very loyal to their owners but can be quite wary of strangers. Ongoing socialization as well as positive new experiences are essential from an early age."

","Responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as hip and elbow dysplasia and eye anomalies. As with all breeds, the Spinone's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, ideally every day, using a toothpaste formulated for dogs.","Despite the standard saying that the breed should be ""kept in a natural state,"" Spinoni do need some grooming. They should be hand-stripped, rather than scissored, to get out the dead hair, as well as maintain a coat length of one and a half to two and a half inches. Spinone need their ears cleaned at least once a week. The legs should be kept in a brushy column, and no feathers left on the tail. Nails should be trimmed once a week.","Spinoni are 'low octane' compared to other sporting breeds. While a hike or walk is always a good idea, it is not something that must be done every day. A large, securely fenced yard and plenty of playtime will keep a Spinone happy, along with being part of the family, which is just as important to his well-being as exercise. Spinoni are not ""kennel dogs,"" or dogs who can just be left alone outside'¿they must be part of the family at all times, which means being a house dog, living inside with the family.","One experienced breeder shares insight on breed trainability: 'Spinoni are very soft, very stubborn, and very smart. Training is mostly about '¿barter.' With many breeds, if you say, '¿Jump,' they will ask, '¿How high?' as they are jumping, whereas a Spinone will ask, '¿Why?' You can teach a Spinone the basics and even train them for competitive obedience'¿just don't expect them to be '¿high and tight' about it every single time. They may tell you, '¿No, not today. Maybe later.' They are smart, but a challenge, and they will shut down if training is too hard or harsh. When hunting, they hunt where they want and will put food on your table. Spinoni are not '¿robot hunters' who will go where you tell them to. Spinoni teach hunters to trust their dogs in the field.'"

","The Stabyhoun is, despite its small population, fortunately a relatively healthy breed. The ASA and the NVSW do everything possible to keep it that way. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as epilepsy, hip and elbow dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, and cerebral dysfunction. The ASA's breeding program is aimed to reduce these occurrences as much as possible, though it is not easy, as the causes are not always clear or strictly hereditary.","A Stabyhoun's grooming needs are almost nonexistent. Unless he is neutered, any necessary hair trimming can be done yourself. A neutered dog also comes with what is called a ""castrated coat"" where the undercoat is exploding and may require a bit more grooming.



 Otherwise, the medium-length coat of the Stabyhoun is self-cleaning, meaning dirt falls off by itself when the coat is dry. One brush through it to remove the last remnants of sand and he is clean again. This also means that he only rarely gets a bath. Even if he really is very dirty, just a rinse or a swim in a clean pool is usually sufficient. Shampoo is only required if he has been rolling in something smelly; then, use a special, neutral dog shampoo so as not to strip his skin oils.","Daily exercise is necessary for the mental and physical health of your Staby. They do not require more than a good daily hour of exercise. Afterward, they are then content to sleep and rest quietly during the day. What is perhaps even more important is that the Staby needs a mental challenge. Stabys need to have a function in daily life, and preference should be given to something that offers variety. Agility, hunting, scent training, and lure coursing can all be productive and stimulating to your Staby. A busy dog is the perfect dog.","Stabys are self-motivated and quick learners. The reason for this lies mainly in the fact that the Staby had to work independently to destroy pests, so it was handy to have a real ""thinker."" That suited the breed well at a time when there were few outside influences and hardly any traffic.



 With positive and gentle training, the Staby is quick to learn and wants to please. Too much pressure is never a good idea, while a good coach is important. The Staby likes a job, but his family must provide a fair and consistent approach to his training, which is very important for a peaceful, happy and diverse education. A tough approach is useless with the Staby. He will completely cease working and no longer voluntarily perform his duties."

","Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as elbow and hip dysplasia, patellar luxation and eye anomalies including hereditary juvenile cataracts, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV), and posterior polar subcapsular cataracts (PPSC). SBTs can develop several forms of skin allergies, some of which may be genetic. The DNA test for L-2-HGA, a metabolic condition, allows breeders to identify carriers and avoid producing affected offspring. Be an informed owner, and discuss any health questions or concerns with your dog's breeder and your veterinarian.","It doesn't take much work to keep a Staffordshire Bull Terrier looking handsome. Occasional baths and weekly brushings with a horsehair mitt or hound glove to pull away dead hairs will keep him in beautiful condition. His nails should be trimmed at least monthly. Avoid letting them grow out too long, as overly long nails can be quite painful for him. Clean the ears regularly to remove excess wax and debris, which can cause an ear infection. Your breeder and your veterinarian can suggest a good routine and cleaning materials and will show you how to do it without damaging his inner ear.","The Stafford requires regular exercise to stay mentally and physically fit. This exercise can be chasing a ball tossed across the backyard, running alongside a biking or jogging owner, or just a nice, long hike through the woods. Although a Stafford in good physical condition can keep up with an athletic owner, they usually settle right in when they come back in the house after a good exercise session. The breed can be heat intolerant and should never be overworked in warm or humid weather.","The Stafford is intelligent, learns easily, responds quickly, is calmly protective, and can be a loving and fun companion. They have an ardent desire to please and easily comply with the requests of their owners. However, remember that they were originally bred to fight other dogs, and most have retained a strong prey drive. They must be trained to control their temperament traits to truly become a perfect pet. It is imperative that from the beginning a Stafford puppy have clear and consistent training.

","According to the health surveys the Standard Schnauzer Club of America does every five years, SS are a very healthy breed. SS are mostly free of many health concerns that affect other breeds. Breeders are conscientious about testing for health concerns such as hip dysplasia and eye disorders,and registering the results with the OFA at the University of Missouri. The new DNA test for cardiomyopathy (which in SS is a simple recessive) allows breeders to identify carriers and breed them to non-carriers so they can eliminate the expression of the disease in the breed.","Standard Schnauzers require regular grooming. Washing beards and leg furnishings, dental care, keeping foreign materials from between foot pads, and nail trims are weekly tasks. SS have a double coat; if the harsh, wiry outer coat is clippered instead of hand-stripped, it loses its dirt-, bramble-, and water resistance, which results in more dirt and shedding of hair in the house. Clippering the coat also makes the coat soft, and each clippering lightens the coat color. Once a coat has been hand-stripped, it can be maintained over a long period of time simply by regular brushing and plucking out long hairs.","Standard Schnauzers are an energetic breed. They love to play, both with their people and with other dogs. They insist on being included in family activities and don't do well left out alone or tied up in the yard. The love long hikes with their people. They're excellent at performance sports such as agility, barn hunt, herding, and lure coursing. As long as their person enjoys an activity, most SS will participate with enthusiasm.","Early socialization in puppyhood is a must. Standard Schnauzers are extremely intelligent, wily, and crafty. They ""get"" an idea or an exercise with very few repetitions. A big problem with SS is over-training; after a few repetitions, they get bored and look at the trainer as though the trainer is stupid. Because of their intelligence, they do require training'¿and if their person doesn't teach them, they learn on their own, but it may not be what the owner wants the dog to learn."

Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as heart problems. Bloat can affect some Sussex, and cancer occurs in mostly older dogs. A genetic test is now available for pdp1, a heritable metabolic, allowing breeders to identify carriers and avoid producing affected offspring.","General grooming for the breed is simply bathing, brushing, and combing. The hair on the bottoms of the feet should be trimmed to keep the dog from slipping. If the dog is neutered, the coat becomes fuzzy and cotton-candy like, and is much harder to deal with. The Sussex should not be shaved down unless absolutely necessary, as it takes a long time for the coat to recover. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly.","The Sussex Spaniel should not have strenuous exercise before he is at least a year old. Sussex are slow growing, and exercise too early can damage the growth plates. Puppies should be allowed to self-exercise by playing. Adult Sussex love swimming and long walks, but jumping and agility-type work should not start until the dog is at least 18 months old.","Sussex can be stubborn; they have long memories and will never forget nor forgive rough handling.

When they are shedding, a warm bath and good massage when shampooing, followed by drying with a dryer and a thorough brushing, can get rid of the worst of it.","There is quite a bit of individual variability in terms of exercise needs in the breed. Some Swedish Vallhunds have more energy than others. Keep in mind that while this isn't a breed intended to run all day, the Vallhund is a working farm dog and needs regular exercise. One decent walk daily with some time playing fetch or performing a sport or other activity is likely adequate for most Vallhunds, but some need more. They also need mental exercise in addition to their physical exercise. Puzzle games, clicker training, and participating in a sport can all contribute to their mental and physical well-being.","Most Vallhunds should want to work with you; that's one of the hallmarks of the breed.

The area behind the ears tends to mat and should be combed frequently, but otherwise the breed's coat does not tend to mat.

","TTs can be a hardy, healthy breed that ages gracefully. But just as second-generation immigrants to Western countries succumb to Western diseases, the same phenomenon might be linked to the shift in TT health issues due to environmental changes in diet and lifestyle from its country of origin. Early spay and neuters can predispose dogs to joint issues. Many breeders request that the dog reach maturity before altering. Geriatric heart murmurs and cataracts are not uncommon in aging TTs. Occasionally senior TTs are struck with vestibular disease, which is fortunately something from which they can recover. Cancer is an increasing concern in aging TTs. Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as allergies, thyroid issues, bladder stones, periodontal disease, hip and patella issues. Genetic tests (such as for NCL, LL, PRA, etc.) are a valuable tool used by breeders to eliminate the expression of those diseases in their puppies.","Prospective TT owners may mistakenly think this is not the dog for them based upon the manicured, flowing coats seen on televised dog shows. But there's an agile, versatile dog underneath with a multi-purpose coat suited for everyday life. TTs have a double coat, the undercoat being wool, resistant to moisture and a natural insulator. Coat textures can vary from softer to harder to more or less prone to matting. The natural coat of the breed can stand up to most anything nature can dish out. It may be convenient to keep the dog in a puppy cut if a full coat hinders desired outdoor adventures. That being said, the real benefit of grooming a TT is that it strengthens the bond in relationship, is great training, and is a way to monitor the dog's health. It may come as a surprise how enjoyable grooming can be.","TTs love to take walks and be outdoors with their people. Individuals within the breed may have more or less drive for exercise. A good breeder will be able to place match each prospective owner with a compatible dog. If you want to hike up a mountain, there's a TT for that. If you're more of a homebody and simply walk around the block or take the stairs a couple times a day, there's a TT for that. Many TTs enjoy a post in the house where they can look out a window or door and perform sentry duty for their household. If this spot is an overlook like a stair landing or balcony, all the better.","This is an independent-minded breed that is quick to learn and will wither under obsessive repetition or harsh methods. Training practices that allow the dog to choose the right behavior are recommended. Clicker-training instruction is widely available, and both human and dog will enjoy the developing partnership from training together. TTs are enthusiastic students who love working closely with their owner (in things such as agility, rally, and nose work) and performing jobs that contribute to the household. They seek companionship based on mutual cooperation, trust, and respect. They have great capacity for love and devotion to their people."

Be sure to always check the dog's ears when he comes in from outside, as ticks love to burrow beneath the coonhound's floppy ears. Removing excess ear wax and debris and checking the ears at least weekly will help you to avoid common ear infections.","The Treeing Walker is a very low-maintenance breed. His short, smooth coat repels dirt and mud, and he will require only the occasional bath to maintain his handsome appearance. Wiping him down with a damp towel or a hound glove will keep his coat shining. His nails should be trimmed every couple of weeks, as long nails can cause the dog discomfort and structural problems. A hound's ears should be cleaned regularly to keep them free of excess wax or debris and to check for any signs of ear infection. The Treeing Walker will look forward to grooming sessions as bonding experiences with the human he loves.","Like most coonhounds, the Treeing Walker is a high-energy breed who delights in stretching his legs in a good, long run. He is an excellent candidate for someone who wants a running or hiking companion. While most coonhounds can quite happily become couch potatoes, most will still appreciate long daily walks at a minimum. Romps in the backyard, chasing a ball, or playing with human or canine friends will help to keep him mentally and physically healthy. The Treeing Walker has a very high prey drive and should be on a leash for walks and hikes, as he may be unable to resist the instinct to pursue an interesting scent.","The Treeing Walker Coonhound is very intelligent and eager to learn.

Responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as such as seasonal allergies; eye disorders, including melanosis or entropion; hip dysplasia; epilepsy; and ear infections. Careful breeders do their homework ahead of time for the best odds of producing sound, healthy pups.","Vizslas have a short, sleek coat with no undercoat, so they don't require complicated grooming. They do shed, and occasional brushing with a rubber grooming brush is helpful. When they get especially dirty (or when they roll in something smelly), they will need a bath with lukewarm water, a good-quality dog soap, and thorough rinsing. It is important to keep the toenails short, either with a clipper or with a grinding tool. Ears should be checked frequently for dirt, wax build-up, or signs of irritation. Regular use of a mild ear-cleaning product will help prevent problems. To keep teeth and gums healthy, regular cleaning is recommended; use a product formulated for dogs (not human toothpaste).","Vizslas were bred to be active hunting dogs, and they need both physical and mental exercise. Individual dogs' needs vary, but, in general, owners should plan on a minimum of 30 minutes of active exercise daily'¿and some dogs will need more than that. In addition to leash walks and games of fetch, most Vizslas need opportunities to run hard off-leash on a regular basis. Mental exercise is as important as physical activity, so training should be part of their routine. Vizslas can be excellent running or jogging companions, with the caveat that young dogs should not run long distances until they reach maturity at about 18 to 24 months. Older Vizslas typically remain active and playful.","Vizslas need consistent, positive training, starting in puppyhood. They are highly intelligent, curious, and sometimes manipulative, so owners need to establish solid communication and teach good behavior. Untrained Vizslas are hard to live with. They can find many creative ways get into trouble if they don't have a 'job.' Fortunately, they typically love training and thrive on the attention they receive. This is a sensitive breed, so early and ongoing socialization is important to make sure the dog has the confidence to enjoy various activities.

","Being a very active breed, Weimaraners get more than their share of accidental cuts, scrapes, sprains, and pulls. They love to chew, and that makes for mouth and gum injury. Be careful of them ingesting things that should not go down a dog' s throat. The most serious health issue in the breed is gastric torsion. This is a life-threatening condition where the stomach gets overstretched and twists shut. Discuss the symptoms with your vet so you can recognize them, and seek immediate veterinary care should it ever occur.","The biggest job in grooming the Weimaraner is keeping the nails short. This is important for the comfort and health of your dog and cannot be overemphasized. When nail length gets out of hand, it's difficult to get it back to a proper length. (If you can hear a tap-tap-tap when they cross a hardwood floor, the nails are too long.) The short coat should be brushed to remove 'dead hair.' Don't forget to clean the ears clean the ears, since having an ear structure that impedes air-flow makes for the potential of infected ears.","Weimaraners have high exercise requirements. They need consistent exercise for their physical and mental well-being. They love a good run. While walking is OK, stretching their legs and getting ""up a full head of steam"" is far better. A tired Weimaraner is a good Weimaraner.","As one longtime breeder says, 'The good news is that Weimaraners are smart; the bad news is that Weimaraners are smart.'

Never allow your Wire Fox Terrier to run off lead, as he is likely to forget all training if he catches sight of a small animal he perceives as prey.","Training the Wire Fox Terrier requires consistency, patience, and a great sense of humor. Spunky and happy-go-lucky little dogs, Wires are very smart but are also somewhat independent and get bored easily, so training sessions must be kept fun and interesting. They react well to positive training methods and will shut down if treated harshly. Wires are wonderfully suited for participation in earthdog trials as well as other performance events that require agility, speed, and intelligence."

","There are several health and genetic screening considerations specific to the Griffon. While the occurrence of hip dysplasia in the Griffon is relatively low, it is still important that dams and sires obtain either OFA or PennHIP clearances. Some breeders also obtain medical clearances for eye, heart, elbow, and thyroid conditions.","The minimally shedding Griffon coat has a harsh outer coat with a soft, insulating undercoat. The breed requires weekly brushing or combing, regular nail trimming, and tooth brushing as well as occasional trimming around the feet and ears. Some coats may need to be hand-stripped periodically to encourage growth of new coat. Like all dogs with drop ears, a Griffon can develop ear infections, so regular cleaning and plucking of ear-canal hair is recommended.","Griffons are social animals who require a great deal of attention, consistent training, time, and patience. Griffons do not make good full-time kennel dogs. They are especially active as puppies, and are very intelligent, social, and physically powerful as adults. They require considerable mental and physical challenges on a daily basis, or they can become bored, unhappy, and/or destructive. The ideal Griffon household is one in which the people are active and include the dog in their daily routines. A Griffon whose mental, emotional, and physical needs are met on a daily basis can be an exceptionally pleasant and easy-to-live-with companion.","The modern WPG still possesses the qualities that Korthals envisioned over a century ago. A versatile gundog with a high degree of trainability, the Griffon excels in hunting upland birds, waterfowl, and furred game. He is a deliberate, thorough, and tireless worker with a strong desire to please his master. Early introduction to game birds and exposure to hunting conditions will bring out the best in this hunting companion. Local AKC pointing-breed clubs as well as North American Versatile Hunting Dog Association chapters can help owners maximize the Griffon's hunting potential with expert training advice for hunting all kinds of game birds. Positive and consistent training is best for the Griffon."

","The Wirehaired Vizsla is a generally healthy breed, and responsible breeders screen their breeding stock for health conditions such as hyperuricosuria (susceptibility to kidney and bladder stones), elbow and hip dysplasia, subaortic stenosis, glaucoma, progressive retinal atrophy, and cataracts.","The Wirehaired Vizsla is something of a 'wash and wear' dog, requiring only minimal grooming to maintain them in good condition. Wiping them down with a damp cloth is usually sufficient in between baths. Using a grooming mitt or shedding knife on their coat during shedding season can help keep down the amount of hair they shed in your home. Toenails should be trimmed every four weeks. Most people find it easiest to do this while the dog is in a tub for his monthly bath. A dental care regimen should be begun at an early age to avoid issues later in life.","The Wirehaired Vizsla is a high-energy dog who needs a lot of exercise. They love being around their people and are happiest doing things together. This makes the breed a great candidate as a canine partner for owners who love to hike, bicycle, or jog. It is imperative that they have opportunities to run freely'¿preferably in a securely fenced area, as their hunting instinct is very strong, and the dog will not be able to resist the urge to pursue prey.","The Wirehaired Vizsla is lively, happy, and eager to please. They have a lot of energy and are very smart but get bored easily. This can sometimes make training a bit difficult, and you must work to keep training sessions fun, interesting, and not too long. They need a light but firm and consistent hand in discipline; a Wirehaired Vizsla needs structure and boundaries. He has a soft temperament, however, and harsh words or physical punishment should be avoided. They have a strong bond with their families, and can develop separation anxiety without proper conditioning."

","The majority of Working Kelpies are healthy dogs. Working with a responsible breeder, those wishing to own a Working Kelpie can gain the education they need to know about specific health concerns within the breed. Good breeders utilize genetic testing of their breeding stock to reduce the likelihood of disease in their puppies.","As a smooth-coated breed with minimal undercoat, it will suffice to occasionally go over your Working Kelpie with a hound mitt to remove any dried-on dirt. Beyond regular weekly grooming, the occasional bath will keep your Working Kelpie clean and looking his best. Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your pet. The strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed when needed with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting, and cracking. The ears should be checked occasionally to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in infection. Teeth should be brushed as needed.","Working Kelpies are very energetic and require a lot of exercise. Options for exercise include play time in the backyard, preferably fenced, or going for walks several times a day. Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or learning new tricks. Certain outdoor activities like hiking and retrieving balls or flying discs can provide a good outlet for expending energy. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience, and rally is also a possibility.","Dogs should be trained or taken to reputable training classes from the age of 16 weeks to learn basic commands. Appropriate advice (e.g. from a reputable livestock working dog handler/trainer or veterinarian, or dog behaviorist) should be sought at the early stages of a behavioral problem. Training sessions should be short and regular and should be determined by the animal's reactions and condition, without overworking the animal."

","Xolos are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will screen their stock for health concerns such as hip dysplasia, patellar luxation, and eye disorders. As with all breeds, the Xolo's ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs. Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure the dog a long, healthy life.","Coated Xolos have an easy-care short coat, requiring only occasional brushing. Adult dogs require minimal grooming, while younger dogs may suffer from adolescent acne when the skin may need special care. Beyond regular weekly grooming, the occasional bath will keep them clean and looking their best. The nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort. Hairless dogs need sunscreen with prolonged exposure to direct sun.","Xolos like long walks and upbeat play, but they are famously tranquil around the house. Young dogs need a substantial amount of exercise and structured playtime, however, to keep them health, happy, and out of trouble.","Xolos need a consistent training regimen and clearly defined boundaries. Early socialization and puppy training classes are vital and help to ensure that the dog grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion. Xolos take their watchdog job seriously but are judicious barkers who only speak when they have something to say. With their loved ones they're cheerful, affectionate pets. If you have allergies but long to own a dog, the hairless Xolo should be on your short list of breeds to consider."

","The Yakutian Laika is a hardy breed, and to keep him that way, responsible breeders check for health concerns such as hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, bloat and certain eye anomalies.","The Yakutian Laika experiences seasonal shedding that can get out of control if he is not brushed regularly. Generally, he should be brushed weekly to prevent matting and tangles. When shedding heavily, it is a good idea to brush him every day to keep the hair from getting onto everything. Use a pin brush and metal comb when grooming. A deshedder or detangler may also make your job a little easier. Since the Yakutian Laika is a working dog, excessive trimming of his coat is not necessary. Trim between his foot pads to keep snow, ice and other debris from accumulating and causing him irritation. His coat naturally repels dirt and he does not have an odor, so bathing should only be done two to three times a year. Trim his nails when needed, usually every two to three weeks. Clean his ears each week as part of his grooming routine.","The Yakutian Laika is a sled dog with a well-defined prey drive. The breed thrives on regular exercise and sufficient training. With a medium-high energy level, they love to run alongside a bike, do sled or rig running, or play fetch in the yard. They play well with other dogs they are familiar with, but are wary of strange dogs and people. Usually, they warm up quickly, but supervision is a good idea in new situations. Yakutian Laikas are not suitable for people who cannot spend time with their dogs.","Training the Yakutian Laika is a rather pleasant and easy task thanks to his biddable nature and keen intelligence. This dog has a strong inclination to independent thinking so he won't follow the handler's orders unless he fully trusts him. Pulling a sled is an inborn talent of this breed, and it doesn't need much training in this respect.



 The Yakutian Laika seeks human leadership and guidance, but he doesn't respond well to corrective training techniques. He works more eagerly if the learning process is based on positive reinforcement and tasty treats. As with any other dog, the Yakutian Laika should learn certain rules and norms of decent behavior in human society, so elementary obedience training is imperative."

","Yorkshire Terriers are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as eye anomalies and luxating patella, a dislocated kneecap once called a 'trick knee' in humans. To help avoid the latter, care should be taken to limit the Yorkie's jumping height, especially as a puppy.","The Yorkshire Terrier's coat is very similar to human hair and should be treated accordingly. If the coat is kept long, it needs to be brushed daily. To avoid eye irritation, the hair on the upper part of the head should be trimmed short or pulled up into a topknot. The Yorkie will need a bath every week or so. Check the ears weekly for any debris or signs of infection. The breed's national parent club, the Yorkshire Terrier Club of America, provides detailed grooming and bathing instructions on its website.","Even small dogs require exercise to stay healthy, both mentally and physically. Yorkies will benefit from both moderate exercise, such as walks with their owner at a steady pace, as well as occasional short bursts of activity, such as chasing after a tennis ball in the backyard. A short walk twice a day will likely be enough for your Yorkie to see new scenery and burn off energy. Participating in dog sports such as obedience or agility also will provide beneficial activity to keep him healthy, while challenging his mind as well.","Yorkies love their owners, and are very intelligent and eager to please. Offering effusive praise and treats for good behavior will work far better with the Yorkie than harsh corrections. Starting from an early age, the Yorkie should be socialized to strange situations, people, and other dogs. Take him into new situations slowly, and always in a calm and happy atmosphere. These should be positive experiences. Despite their small size, Yorkies can participate in and excel at canine activities such as rally, agility and obedience, and many Yorkies serve with their human partners in roles such as therapy work."
